Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3.

In the Clothier home, we like them to still be a bit green - they are firmer and have a better flavor. But there's a lot to consider: How many to get? How many do I think we will eat in the next few days? Is one a day good, or will my wife and I both eat one each day? What about if I want to put them in cereal or something else? And the most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch or empty handed is how green they are. Occasionally, I will find some that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now.\n[2 - 3] But no matter how hard I plan, there always seems to be one or two that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. It is in these situations that I think banana bread was first conceived - a way to use those blackening bananas before they go to waste.\n[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. The added texture and flavor is well worth the extra calories.\n[6 - 7] Since this is one of those things I don't make very often, I don't give much thought as to how bad it is for you. I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym...\n[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients\n[9 - 10] For the Bread:\n[10 - 11] 3 - 4 Bananas, Mashed\n[11 - 12] 2 Cups all-purpose Flour\n[12 - 13] 3/4 Cup White Sugar\n[13 - 14] 1/4 Cup Brown Sugar\n[14 - 15] 1 Stick Butter, Softened\n[15 - 16] 2 Eggs, Slightly Beaten\n[16 - 17] 1 tsp Vanilla\n[17 - 18] 1 tsp Baking Soda\n[18 - 19] 1/2 tsp Salt\n[20 - 21] For the Topping:\n[21 - 22] 2 Tbsp Olive Oil\n[22 - 23] 1/3 Cup Brown Sugar\n[23 - 24] 1 Tbsp Cinnamon\n[25 - 26] Optional:\n[26 - 27] 1 Cup Walnuts, Chopped\n[28 - 29] Oven Temp:\n[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\n[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas\n[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. It's OK if they have a few spots, but you can cut away the super gross black parts if there are any if that freaks you out. Also, peel off any of those clingy strings...\n[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash those bananas into oblivion! Be careful though, I actually shattered a spoon once when I got a bit too excited. This can be a stress reliever or an arm workout - your choice.\n[36 - 37] Keep it up until the banana are mostly liquified. It's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture.\n[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start\n[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened (try not to melt it completely!) combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. A fork or a strong whisk works best for this procedure. Mix until everything is well blended and creamy.\n[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up\n[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla and butter/sugar mixture into the bananas. If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so.\n[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend\n[45 - 46] Finally, add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. Once you are satisfied, pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable.\n[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It...\n[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. Then, sprinkle it over top of the batter. It's OK to make extra and really put it on thick. Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter, and I'm trying to reduce my intake. If you would rather go that route, use a one to two tablespoons of butter instead of the oil.\n[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It\n[51 - 52] In case you forgot to do so earlier, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When it is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. For muffins, 18 to 20 minutes should be good. Be sure to test them with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. When you are satisfied, let them cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched.\n[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that...\n\n```\n"

(Overview)\n[0 - 1] In the Clothier home, we like bananas to still be a bit green because they are firmer and have a better flavor. (Explanation)\n[0 - 1] Consider how many bananas to get based on how many you think will be eaten in the next few days. (Method)\n[0 - 1] Decide if one banana a day is good or if both you and your wife will eat one each day. (Method)\n[0 - 1] Think about using bananas in cereal or other dishes. (Method)\n[0 - 1] The most important variable that determines if I leave with a bunch of bananas or empty handed is how green they are. (Explanation)\n[0 - 1] Occasionally, find some bananas that will be perfect in a couple of days and pair them with a few that are perfect right now. (Method)\n[2 - 3] There always seems to be one or two bananas that go uneaten or ripen a lot quicker than expected. (Overview)\n[2 - 3] Banana bread was first conceived as a way to use blackening bananas before they go to waste. (Explanation)\n[4 - 5] The best thing about these muffins is the crumbly coating that goes on top of them. (Description)\n[4 - 5] The added texture and flavor of the crumbly coating is well worth the extra calories. (Explanation)\n[6 - 7] I don't give much thought as to how bad these muffins are for you since I don't make them very often. (Description)\n[6 - 7] I'd rather be happy and plump than starve myself endlessly. (Explanation)\n[6 - 7] If worse comes to worst, there's always the gym. (Miscellaneous)\n[8 - 9] Step 1: Ingredients (Method)\n[9 - 10] For the Bread: (Method)\n[10 - 11] Add 3 to 4 bananas, mashed. (Method)\n[11 - 12] Add 2 cups of all-purpose flour. (Method)\n[12 - 13] Add 3/4 cup of white sugar. (Method)\n[13 - 14] Add 1/4 cup of brown sugar. (Method)\n[14 - 15] Add 1 stick of softened butter. (Method)\n[15 - 16] Add 2 eggs, slightly beaten. (Method)\n[16 - 17] Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. (Method)\n[17 - 18] Add 1 teaspoon of baking soda. (Method)\n[18 - 19] Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt. (Method)\n[20 - 21] For the Topping: (Method)\n[21 - 22] Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. (Method)\n[22 - 23] Add 1/3 cup of brown sugar. (Method)\n[23 - 24] Add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. (Method)\n[26 - 27] Optional: Add 1 cup of chopped walnuts. (Method)\n[29 - 30] Once you have everything, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. (Method)\n[31 - 32] Step 2: Mush Those Bananas (Method)\n[32 - 33] Peel the bananas and place them in a large bowl. (Method)\n[32 - 33] Cut away any super gross black parts of the bananas if that freaks you out. (Supplementary)\n[32 - 33] Peel off any clingy strings from the bananas. (Method)\n[34 - 35] Using a strong utensil, smush, smash, mush, and mash the bananas into oblivion. (Method)\n[34 - 35] Be careful when mashing the bananas to avoid breaking your utensil. (Supplementary)\n[36 - 37] Keep mashing until the bananas are mostly liquified, but it's OK to have a few bits and pieces for consistency and texture. (Method)\n[38 - 39] Step 3: A Sweet Start (Method)\n[39 - 40] Once the butter is softened, combine it with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. (Method)\n[39 - 40] A fork or a strong whisk works best for mixing the butter and sugars. (Supplementary)\n[39 - 40] Mix until everything is well blended and creamy. (Method)\n[41 - 42] Step 4: Mix It Up (Method)\n[42 - 43] Beat the 2 eggs, vanilla, and butter/sugar mixture into the mashed bananas. (Method)\n[42 - 43] If you are adding walnuts, now is a good time to do so. (Method)\n[44 - 45] Step 5: Flour Is Your Friend (Method)\n[45 - 46] Add the flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until it is totally incorporated. (Method)\n[45 - 46] Pour the mixture into your cooking pan of choice. (Method)\n[45 - 46] With this batch, I made muffins, but a loaf or cake pan is also acceptable. (Explanation)\n[47 - 48] Step 6: Coat It... (Method)\n[48 - 49] To make the topping, blend the olive oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon until it is very crumbly. (Method)\n[48 - 49] Sprinkle the topping over the batter. (Method)\n[48 - 49] It's OK to make extra topping and really put it on thick. (Supplementary)\n[48 - 49] Typically, butter is used to make a streusel, but there is already a stick in the batter. (Explanation)\n[48 - 49] If you would rather use butter for the topping, use one to two tablespoons instead of the oil. (Supplementary)\n[50 - 51] Step 7: And Cook It (Method)\n[51 - 52] Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F if you forgot to do so earlier. (Method)\n[51 - 52] When the oven is ready, bake the batter appropriately for your cooking pan. (Method)\n[51 - 52] For muffins, bake for 18 to 20 minutes. (Method)\n[51 - 52] Test the muffins with a clean knife or toothpick to make sure they are done. (Method)\n[51 - 52] Let the muffins cool on a rack for 15 minutes, or until they can be safely touched. (Method)\n[53 - 54] I think you can figure out what to do after that... (Conclusion)\n\n```\n"

But best of all... these muffins are seriously delicious.\n[3 - 4] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with chocolate chips and banana chips}\n[5 - 6] Things You'll Need\n[6 - 7] 3 very ripe bananas (or 1 cup of applesauce)\n[7 - 8] 1 cup milk (dairy, coconut, or almond)\n[8 - 9] 1/2 cup peanut butter (or any nut butter)\n[9 - 10] 2 eggs\n[10 - 11] 1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey)\n[11 - 12] 1 teaspoon vanilla\n[12 - 13] 1 tablespoon baking powder\n[13 - 14] 1/4 cup flaxseed (ground)\n[14 - 15] 1 tablespoon chia seeds\n[15 - 16] 3 cups whole oats\n[16 - 17] Optional toppings: chocolate chips, dried banana chips\n[18 - 19] Tip\n[19 - 20] The peanut butter-banana base can be adapted to suit many different tastes. Applesauce works in place of bananas and any nut butter can pinch hit for the peanut butter.\n[21 - 22] {image caption}{Ingredients for oatmeal protein muffins}\n[23 - 24] Get Started\n[24 - 25] Set your oven to 375 degrees F and grease the muffin pan. Use coconut oil, spray or butter to grease your pan. Next, mash your bananas in a large mixing bowl.\n[26 - 27] {image caption}{When it comes to baking with bananas, the browner the better. They'll have more flavor.}\n[28 - 29] {image caption}{A potato masher works best but a fork would also do for very ripe bananas.}\n[30 - 31] Add the Remaining Ingredients\n[31 - 32] There's no way to mess this up. Simply combine all the ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.\n[33 - 34] {image caption}{Use regular milk, almond milk or coconut milk.}\n[35 - 36] {image caption}{No need to beat the eggs ahead of time, just crack and mix.}\n[37 - 38] {image caption}{We used maple syrup here but honey is also delicious.}\n[39 - 40] {image caption}{Make this recipe gluten-free with specially marked containers of whole oats.}\n[41 - 42] {image caption}{Without flour in the recipe, there's no worry of over-mixing.}\n[43 - 44] Prepare to Bake\n[44 - 45] Fill muffin cups to the top. A 3-ounce ice cream scoop works perfectly for evenly distributing muffin batter into pans. This is the time to add optional toppings such as chocolate chips or banana chips.\n[46 - 47] {image caption}{Tip: Place a couple of chocolate or banana chips in the bottom of each cup before ladling in the batter.}\n[48 - 49] {image caption}{Try using coconut oil spray to grease the pan. It's delicious!}\n[50 - 51] Bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes. Then cool on a rack.\n[52 - 53] {image caption}{Oatmeal protein muffins with banana chips on top}\n[54 - 55] Store refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days. Or freeze in a single layer, inside a zip-top freezer bag.\n[56 - 57] {image caption}{Mix and match your toppings, or add more.}\n\n```\n"

Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[1 - 2] This recipe is a one-bowl oatmeal protein muffin recipe.

Derive canonical procedure_segments\n- For every `Method` piece, convert it to <object(s)> or <action> or <action> + <object(s)>, where <action> is a single verb and <object(s)> is a single object or a list of objects. Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.

6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?\n[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.\n[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.\n[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.\n[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.\n[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.\n[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.\n[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.\n[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.\n[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.\n[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.\n[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.\n[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.\n[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.\n[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.\n[85 - 86] Sift it out.\n[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.\n[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.\n[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.\n[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.\n[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.\n[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.\n[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.\n[114 - 115] In you go.\n[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.\n[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.\n[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?\n[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.\n[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.\n[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.\n[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.\n[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.\n[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.\n[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.\n[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.\n[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.\n[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.\n[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.\n[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.\n[178 - 180] What's going on here?\n[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.\n[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.\n[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.\n[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.\n[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.\n[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.\n[199 - 200] That's nice.\n[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.\n[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.\n[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.\n[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.\n[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.\n[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.\n[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.\n[237 - 238] There we go.\n[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.\n[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.\n[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.\n[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.\n[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.\n[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.\n[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.\n[288 - 289] In you go.\n[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.\n[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.\n[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.\n[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.\n[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.\n[318 - 319] It'll burn.\n[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.\n[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.\n[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.\n[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.\n[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.\n[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.\n[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.\n[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.\n[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.\n[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.\n[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.\n[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.\n[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.\n[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.\n[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.\n[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.\n[417 - 418] Take a look.\n[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.\n[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.\n[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.\n[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.\n[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.\n[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.\n[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?\n[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.\n[445 - 450] If you like my videos, hit that like button, subscribe, and I'll see you in the next video.\n\n```\n"

4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.\n[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.\n[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.\n[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.\n[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.\n[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.\n[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.\n[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.\n[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.\n[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.\n[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.\n[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.\n[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.\n[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\n[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.\n[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.\n[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.\n[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.\n[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.\n[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.\n[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.\n[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.\n[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.\n[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.\n[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.\n[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.\n[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.\n[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.\n[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.\n[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.\n[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.\n[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.\n[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.\n[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.\n[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.\n[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.\n[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.\n[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.\n[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.\n[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.\n[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.\n[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.\n[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.\n[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.\n[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.\n[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.\n[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.\n[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.\n[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.\n[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.\n[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.\n[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.\n[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.\n[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.\n[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.\n[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.\n[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.\n[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.\n[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.\n[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.\n[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.\n[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.\n[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.\n[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.\n[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.\n[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.\n[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.\n[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.\n[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.\n[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.\n[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.\n[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.\n[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.\n[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.\n[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.\n[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.\n[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.\n[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.\n[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.\n[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.\n[522 - 531] Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos, where you can find hundreds of restaurant quality recipes you can easily make at home.\n[531 - 533] We'll see you later.\n\n```\n"

(Overview)\n[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. (Overview)\n[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. (Method)\n[18 - 23] Line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. (Method)\n[23 - 30] Give the paper baking cups a spritz of nonstick cooking spray to prevent the muffins from sticking. (Method)\n[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together the batter. (Method)\n[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter. (Method)\n[32 - 42] Then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe. (Method)\n[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter and 1 cup of granulated sugar. (Method)\n[48 - 50] Use a hand mixer to cream the butter and sugar together. (Method)\n[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes. (Explanation)\n[56 - 63] After 2 minutes the sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste-like creamy consistency. (Explanation)\n[63 - 69] Add in 2 large eggs and mix briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds. (Method)\n[70 - 81] Add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, or lemon extract. (Method)\n[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts, I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. (Supplementary)\n[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt. (Method)\n[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. (Method)\n[101 - 105] Give this a quick mix just to combine for about 10 seconds. (Method)\n[106 - 111] Now it's time to ditch the hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula. (Method)\n[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your all-purpose flour. (Method)\n[113 - 116] Use 2 cups total, so add in 1 cup right now. (Method)\n[116 - 119] Use the rubber spatula to stir this in. (Method)\n[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. (Method)\n[125 - 133] Buttermilk will give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and stir this in until it's well combined. (Explanation)\n[133 - 137] Last, add in the remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour. (Method)\n[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in. (Method)\n[142 - 150] If you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so. (Method)\n[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable. (Description)\n[153 - 160] Divide the batter up amongst the 12 muffin cups, filling each one about 2 thirds of the way full. (Method)\n[160 - 169] Try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins. (Supplementary)\n[169 - 181] Let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches. (Method)\n[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. (Method)\n[185 - 191] After 7 minutes, reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door. (Method)\n[191 - 199] Continue baking for 12 to 15 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven. (Method)\n[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin. (Overview)\n[204 - 209] This demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit. (Explanation)\n[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt. (Method)\n[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk. (Method)\n[232 - 240] Once you have your batter finished, add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen ones can be used too. (Method)\n[240 - 241] This is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. (Supplementary)\n[241 - 248] Fold this in. (Method)\n[248 - 255] Divide the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups. (Method)\n[255 - 257] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. (Supplementary)\n[257 - 260] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top. (Explanation)\n[260 - 263] Bake these just as we did before. (Method)\n[263 - 274] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version. (Method)\n[274 - 284] For a chocolate version, use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time add in 1 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and cream that in with it. (Method)\n[284 - 289] Proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. (Method)\n[289 - 294] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter. (Explanation)\n[294 - 304] Add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in. (Method)\n[304 - 312] You can mix and match add-ins, but you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total. (Supplementary)\n[312 - 328] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding. (Method)\n[328 - 332] This time you're only going to add in 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 1/4 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors. (Method)\n[332 - 337] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed. (Method)\n[337 - 349] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted. (Method)\n[349 - 357] This variation is fun because there are so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, making it easy to mix and match flavors quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts. (Explanation)\n[357 - 363] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match add-ins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle. (Overview)\n[363 - 367] I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip muffin with a little bit of orange zest. (Method)\n[367 - 374] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it. (Description)\n[374 - 380] Add in 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, because we're going to use 1 cup of add-ins total. (Method)\n[380 - 389] The white chocolate chips will also come in at 1/2 cup for 1 cup total. (Method)\n[389 - 396] A little bit of orange zest, 1/2 tablespoon total, will add just a hint of orange flavor. (Supplementary)\n[396 - 401] Fold this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed. (Method)\n[401 - 402] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless. (Miscellaneous)\n[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy. (Method)\n[418 - 427] I'm going to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious. (Description)\n[427 - 430] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. (Method)\n[430 - 435] You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon. (Supplementary)\n[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk. (Method)\n[441 - 449] Fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays. (Method)\n[449 - 455] Divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping. (Method)\n[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins. (Description)\n[462 - 465] It starts with 1/4 cup of cold cubed butter. (Method)\n[465 - 474] Add in 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, adding in 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. (Method)\n[474 - 479] Use a pastry cutter or two knives, cutting across each other. (Method)\n[479 - 485] Cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand. (Method)\n[485 - 490] Sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter. (Method)\n[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin. (Description)\n[495 - 498] The baking time on all of these is the same. (Conclusion)\n[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe. (Conclusion)\n[516 - 517] Thanks for watching. (Greeting)\n[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description. (Supplementary)\n[522 - 531] Be sure to subscribe, like, and follow, and check out the rest of my videos, where you can find hundreds of restaurant quality recipes you can easily make at home. (Miscellaneous)\n[531 - 533] We'll see you later. (Greeting)\n\n```\n"
