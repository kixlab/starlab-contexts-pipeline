(Greeting)\n[6 - 10] My name is Jenna. (Greeting)\n[10 - 16] Today's video is meant for people dealing with snow days and bored children as a result of the snow days. (Overview)\n[16 - 21] I live in Australia but I am from the northeastern part of the United States. (Overview)\n[21 - 24] You guys have had some weather recently. (Overview)\n[24 - 30] Facebook was blowing up with complaints about snow days. (Overview)\n[30 - 40] If you have young children stuck inside all day, this project is great for imagination and playing dress-up. (Overview)\n[58 - 62] You don't have to be in a snowy area to do this project. (Overview)\n[66 - 69] This is the classic newspaper paper hat. (Overview)\n[69 - 70] You probably already have all the materials necessary to make this project. (Overview)\n[74 - 77] You need one sheet of newspaper. (Method)\n[82 - 91] Take a half-size newspaper or fold a big one in half and then in half again until you have a rectangle. (Method)\n[96 - 100] Fold one corner in to make a right triangle. (Method)\n[106 - 109] Fold the other corner in to make another right triangle. (Method)\n[113 - 114] You will have a long skinny strip down and two triangles up top. (Description)\n[120 - 121] Fold the flap up onto itself to meet the bottom of the triangles. (Method)\n[130 - 134] Fold it up again. (Method)\n[134 - 139] Turn it around and fold the bottom flap up to meet roughly at the bottom of the triangle. (Method)\n[145 - 152] Guess where the bottom is by looking at the other side; it doesn't have to be perfect. (Supplementary)\n[154 - 158] Fold that rectangle up again to match the other side. (Method)\n[165 - 169] Open it up to see it creates what appears to be like a captain's hat. (Method)\n[173 - 177] Thank you for bearing with me while I tried to see myself in the screen. (Miscellaneous)\n[180 - 186] That's it! (Conclusion)\n[188 - 191] I have another couple of videos that work great with this, called the captain's shirt story. (Supplementary)\n[194 - 196] It uses this as a base and turns into a really neat interesting story. (Explanation)\n[200 - 202] Let me know in the comments below if you're interested in going further with this fold. (Miscellaneous)\n[208 - 211] Please comment on the captain's shirt story or anything else you'd like to put down there. (Miscellaneous)\n[215 - 218] Thank you so much for watching. (Greeting)\n[218 - 221] Please subscribe if you enjoy paper crafting. (Miscellaneous)\n[221 - 234] I hope you have a fabulous day. (Greeting)\n[234 - 234] Bye! (Greeting)\n\n```\n"

Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3.

Derive canonical procedure_segments\n- For every `Method` piece, convert it to <object(s)> or <action> or <action> + <object(s)>, where <action> is a single verb and <object(s)> is a single object or a list of objects. Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3.

Work strictly in the order below.\n\n1. Derive canonical procedure_segments\n- For every `Method` piece, convert it to <object(s)> or <action> or <action> + <object(s)>, where <action> is a single verb and <object(s)> is a single object or a list of objects. Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[2 - 4] Hello and welcome to the video.

(Explanation)\n[22 - 24] Start off with a square piece of paper. (Method)\n[24 - 30] The square should be approximately 21.5 centimeters or 8.5 inches on each side. (Method)\n[44 - 47] Cut two slits at the top of the square. (Method)\n[47 - 50] Each slit should be about 3 inches or 7 centimeters long. (Method)\n[66 - 69] Fold the two slits so that the edges match nicely. (Method)\n[79 - 85] Use tape to secure the folded edges together. (Method)\n[98 - 102] You will now have a shape resembling a nurse hat. (Description)\n[102 - 106] Take the top part of the hat and fold it over the other two parts. (Method)\n[110 - 114] Use tape to secure the top part in place. (Method)\n[118 - 125] You should now have a completed hat shape.

Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.

(Description)\n[16 - 20] I'm going to do it step by step. (Overview)\n[20 - 23] You can use any type of paper you want. (Method)\n[23 - 25] Wake up and use your newspaper for now. (Method)\n[25 - 28] The first thing you need to do is to make sure that it's flat on the edges. (Method)\n[28 - 33] Make sure the edges are even and definitely flat on this side. (Method)\n[33 - 37] You don't want it all bumpy. (Supplementary)\n[37 - 39] That's how flat it should be. (Description)\n[44 - 46] Fold it in half. (Method)\n[46 - 49] You need to fold it so it's perfectly aligned with the edge. (Method)\n[59 - 64] Now we have to make sure it's flattened down.

3] today we're going to make hats oh did\n[3 - 5] you see I took off my hat\n[5 - 6] that's right take off your hat it'll\n[6 - 8] take my dog we're gonna make hats out of\n[8 - 12] newspaper and for this all you need is\n[12 - 14] newspaper so I'll take one of these one\n[14 - 16] sheet while you're there so what do we\n[16 - 19] read in today no no no we're just not\n[19 - 21] reading we're making hats we're making\n[21 - 24] hat so all right so normally a newspaper\n[24 - 26] is already folded so we can already\n[26 - 27] leave that folded right there\n[27 - 29] great just like this and we're going to\n[29 - 31] take that and we're going to you know\n[31 - 33] they say what did they say when when\n[33 - 35] you're folding it there's hot dog and\n[35 - 37] hamburger is that right so that's ham\n[37 - 40] hamburger is a cross you know so you\n[40 - 42] have a wider one and then hotdog would\n[42 - 44] be the thinner one right yep\n[44 - 46] so what we want to do is we want to give\n[46 - 49] one fold in half hamburger style number\n[49 - 52] seven all right so then we're making a\n[52 - 55] crease right down the middle of it it\n[55 - 56] doesn't even it doesn't have to be\n[56 - 58] perfect that pair of nothing has to be\n[58 - 61] right so now we have a nice crease right\n[61 - 63] there right in the middle and now we're\n[63 - 66] going to make we're going to fold the\n[66 - 68] corners the top two corners where the\n[68 - 71] fold is you see that there's already\n[71 - 72] pulled down we're going to fold those\n[72 - 75] corners in at the half\n[75 - 78] like right along that crease so there's\n[78 - 81] one side you see and then here's the\n[81 - 83] other side and we'll both do them on the\n[83 - 89] same same side here so now what you have\n[89 - 93] should look like this that's what you\n[93 - 95] should be seeing and this should be kind\n[95 - 97] of open on the bottom right did you have\n[97 - 99] a couple scoops oh how you doing there\n[99 - 101] Brian I think I'm doing pretty well\n[101 - 105] all right good so now the next step is\n[105 - 107] that we're going to see yeah the bottom\n[107 - 109] edge around here right here and you see\n[109 - 111] how you have two sheets it looks like\n[111 - 113] you have two sheets of paper there\n[113 - 115] together for we're going to fold the\n[115 - 118] first sheet of paper up so just one yeah\n[118 - 120] and it's kind of like I guess hot dog\n[120 - 123] style you're gonna pull it right all the\n[123 - 125] way up make it so it looks like this\n[125 - 128] right yeah that's right it's a nice\n[128 - 130] thick creaser so then so this is what\n[130 - 132] that side should look like is that you\n[132 - 134] folded right along this\n[134 - 138] were those two triangles where those two\n[138 - 140] corners came in and you fold it right up\n[140 - 143] along here okay so now you're gonna flip\n[143 - 147] it over so you see just the back back\n[147 - 150] and now this is where we're gonna size\n[150 - 152] it now I have a really big head so I'm\n[152 - 155] only gonna do small yeah so I'm gonna\n[155 - 158] make I'll make a smaller hat for the\n[158 - 159] people on the internet because they\n[159 - 160] probably don't have as big a head as I\n[160 - 162] do and then you're trying to make a big\n[162 - 164] hat so they could fit around your food\n[164 - 166] around my head so what what we do here\n[166 - 170] is we take these sides the whole side\n[170 - 172] right here and we fold it in so here's\n[172 - 174] one side we're gonna fold this in you\n[174 - 177] know we're Emison as much as our much so\n[177 - 180] if you have like a smaller head you can\n[180 - 183] fold it in like you know a couple three\n[183 - 186] inches right there but if you have a\n[186 - 188] bigger head like me you can fold it in\n[188 - 191] fold it in just a little bit like that\n[191 - 193] now do the same on the other side fold\n[193 - 198] it up and in like that make a nice\n[198 - 200] little crease so now if you're holding\n[200 - 202] them because they're gonna try to flap\n[202 - 203] out they look like this so this is what\n[203 - 207] your back should look like and then just\n[207 - 209] like on the front side you're going to\n[209 - 212] fold this right up fold this bottom edge\n[212 - 215] right up so now it's all and not on the\n[215 - 217] same size but on the opposite so on the\n[217 - 219] opposite side so now you'll still have\n[219 - 221] that little space right in the middle\n[221 - 224] and that's a base that your head goes no\n[224 - 228] if you start popping it out a little bit\n[228 - 230] you're the Apple about it it fits my\n[230 - 232] head does it fit your head I got it\n[232 - 236] perfect size the one size fits all it's\n[236 - 238] supposed to go to the front leg well you\n[238 - 239] can do that whichever way you want it to\n[239 - 243] be turned that looks really good musics\n[243 - 246] great awesome well that's how we make a\n[246 - 247] paper right now there are other things\n[247 - 250] we can do with this what can we do we\n[250 - 252] can put little things in this little in\n[252 - 253] the little room in your little brim you\n[253 - 255] can have things hanging out and you will\n[255 - 260] decorate your hats in fact I'm going to\n[260 - 263] add something you have okay I'm gonna\n[263 - 266] make it funnier funny hats no no you're\n[266 - 271] yo little a nice little I my third\n[271 - 273] googly eye there and their way here I\n[273 - 275] have another one okay we need to get as\n[275 - 277] many eyes as we can right and then\n[277 - 280] another googly eye there right now your\n[280 - 291] hat has eyes awesome\n[302 - 302] alright by the way that is our crafty\n[302 - 310] mid cross craft craft\n\n```\n"

Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3.

2] hey everybody this is gonna be a\n[2 - 5] tutorial on how to make a paper hat so\n[5 - 7] the first step is you want to draw three\n[7 - 10] shapes that look like this now the first\n[10 - 13] shape you draw is gonna have a curve\n[13 - 16] right there and then the second one is\n[16 - 19] gonna be a little bit less curved but a\n[19 - 21] slant going up there but a small slit\n[21 - 23] and then the third is going to be the\n[23 - 25] smallest piece and the less curved on\n[25 - 27] the edge once you have this drawing out\n[27 - 28] what you're gonna do is you're gonna cut\n[28 - 31] each one out after you cut them out\n[31 - 32] you're gonna have three of these and\n[32 - 35] you're gonna take one of them put them\n[35 - 37] on a white piece of paper and trace\n[37 - 39] around because what you're doing is\n[39 - 41] you're you're making two of each shape\n[41 - 43] and so you're making sure that each one\n[43 - 45] is the same size as the one before\n[45 - 47] because if it's not the hats not gonna\n[47 - 54] fit together correctly and once you have\n[54 - 56] all those traced what you're gonna do is\n[56 - 58] take some scissors and you're gonna cut\n[58 - 63] each one out this is the time to color\n[63 - 66] them and if you want to once you have\n[66 - 67] them all cut out what you're gonna do is\n[67 - 69] you're gonna take one of them and you're\n[69 - 71] gonna draw lines like this around the\n[71 - 73] edge these represent the seams of the\n[73 - 76] Hat and if you want to you can also do a\n[76 - 79] dotted line for these instead but you\n[79 - 82] can do it however you want and you're\n[82 - 88] gonna do that for every single one\n[90 - 90] make sure that for these pieces the two\n[90 - 92] largest ones the slant is going down on\n[92 - 94] that side and going up on that one it's\n[94 - 98] almost like a mirror image once you have\n[98 - 100] them all drawn on what you're gonna do\n[100 - 103] is you're gonna take these to make sure\n[103 - 105] it's those two take a piece of tape tape\n[105 - 107] on the back and then you're gonna put\n[107 - 109] together you are now starting to put the\n[109 - 115] Hat together take another piece of tape\n[115 - 117] and put it on the back and put them\n[117 - 119] together you're gonna be doing this for\n[119 - 122] each one just make sure that you don't\n[122 - 124] tape too close to the top because when\n[124 - 126] you're done sometimes it doesn't fit\n[126 - 129] together quite right so you want to make\n[129 - 130] sure you have enough room if you need to\n[130 - 133] adjust now the next two pieces is you\n[133 - 136] want to put ones of the smallest ones on\n[136 - 138] one side and the other smallest piece on\n[138 - 141] the other side each side has to be\n[141 - 142] symmetrical because if you don't put\n[142 - 144] them in to get together in the right\n[144 - 145] order the hats not going to come out\n[145 - 147] right so you have to make sure you're\n[147 - 151] doing it in this order and then take\n[151 - 154] that other small piece and attach it to\n[154 - 173] the other side like that\n[175 - 175] now for the two largest pieces which are\n[175 - 176] the two lost you have to be careful\n[176 - 179] about this make sure that the slants on\n[179 - 181] this are going kind of in the mirror\n[181 - 184] image again going opposite but then\n[184 - 185] after that you just do what you've been\n[185 - 187] doing the whole time taping on the back\n[187 - 191] and then putting together like this just\n[191 - 193] like that just make sure that the slants\n[193 - 201] are going the opposite direction\n[204 - 204] these two last pieces are usually the\n[204 - 206] most difficult to put together because\n[206 - 207] everything is a little bit crowded\n[207 - 210] because it's making the circular shape\n[210 - 214] so it may be a little bit difficult in\n[214 - 216] the video you can tell that I'm gonna\n[216 - 219] have a little bit of trouble with it but\n[219 - 221] it seemed pretty easy to work around but\n[221 - 225] just keep taping to the back and then\n[225 - 231] putting it together like that and if you\n[231 - 233] have a gap at the top that's completely\n[233 - 235] fine or if you have a little bit of tape\n[235 - 241] left over there don't worry about it and\n[241 - 243] if you do have any extra tape up there\n[243 - 245] what you can do is just take some\n[245 - 247] scissors and cut off the extra tape and\n[247 - 248] don't worry about that gap at the top\n[248 - 252] because that's gonna be covered up later\n[252 - 254] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna\n[254 - 256] take some cardboard make sure it's thin\n[256 - 257] cardboard you can use anything you want\n[257 - 259] as you can see here I use some Ritz\n[259 - 262] cardboard so you can do anything you\n[262 - 269] really want make about six tabs like\n[269 - 272] that you you actually really only need\n[272 - 277] four but um I'm just doing that in case\n[277 - 279] I mess out so then take some tape you\n[279 - 281] can bend it too it might make it easier\n[281 - 283] and then put it in like that and just\n[283 - 287] keep taping around the entire hat this\n[287 - 288] is to make the Hat more sturdy and it\n[288 - 292] also gives the Hat the round shape so\n[292 - 294] that if you wear it it won't crumble or\n[294 - 297] anything when you put it on and so just\n[297 - 299] keep taping around the top and bottom\n[299 - 300] make sure they're on there correctly\n[300 - 303] make sure they won't fall off and you\n[303 - 305] may notice you can see through the white\n[305 - 307] hat to the cardboard but that's fine if\n[307 - 309] you have your head actually colored in\n[309 - 311] right now you um you probably can't even\n[311 - 315] see it so it's fine now what you're\n[315 - 317] gonna do is you're gonna make the brim\n[317 - 319] for that so put the Hat down like that\n[319 - 322] and you're gonna make kind of a half\n[322 - 328] circle like this yeah and kind of draw\n[328 - 331] it in lightly in case you mess up so you\n[331 - 333] can erase it and there won't be any left\n[333 - 334] over\n[334 - 338] marks and once you have it right or how\n[338 - 341] you like it just go around and darken it\n[341 - 345] back in like that and then put the hat\n[346 - 348] back on and you're just gonna make a\n[348 - 351] half circle around the edges like this\n[351 - 357] and by now which it look like a half\n[357 - 361] moon and then just darken it in and then\n[361 - 364] once you have it all darken in you're\n[364 - 367] gonna cut it out with some scissors and\n[367 - 370] this is when you can color the Birman if\n[370 - 373] you want to now what we're gonna do is\n[373 - 376] you're gonna take some pencil and you're\n[376 - 378] gonna draw some lines like this these\n[378 - 383] represent the seams of the brim so just\n[383 - 389] draw it around like that you can also do\n[389 - 392] these dotted lines here instead if you\n[392 - 395] want but you can do it any way and just\n[395 - 398] keep doing that but before you get to\n[398 - 401] the very end about this point stop and\n[401 - 406] just leave that area blank in there now\n[406 - 407] you're gonna take some cardboard and\n[407 - 412] you're gonna trace around the paper it's\n[412 - 414] okay if the cardboard is a little bit\n[414 - 417] too small as you can see here I have him\n[417 - 418] used a little bit too small a piece but\n[418 - 420] it's fine just make sure it's not too\n[420 - 422] small and then you're gonna cut it out\n[422 - 425] because this is gonna make the brim more\n[425 - 428] stiff\n[430 - 430] and then you're gonna take some glue\n[430 - 433] glue the cardboard and then you're just\n[433 - 437] gonna put the brim the paper broom onto\n[437 - 443] the cardboard\n[446 - 446] once you're done with that you can flip\n[446 - 449] it over and if you have any writing like\n[449 - 453] here and writing like that what you do\n[453 - 457] is you trace around and then you cut\n[457 - 459] that out and then you're just gonna put\n[459 - 460] it over the words or whatever there is\n[460 - 462] there so you don't see it and then put\n[462 - 464] it down like that and if you can still\n[464 - 466] see through you just do it again\n[466 - 469] and then you won't be able to see it now\n[469 - 470] what you're gonna do is you're gonna\n[470 - 473] make sure that shape is the same shape\n[473 - 475] you see on the Hat it has to be that\n[475 - 478] shape because that's the front tape the\n[478 - 487] brim put a few pieces on and tape it to\n[487 - 490] the bottom of the Hat make sure it's on\n[490 - 499] straight\n[502 - 502] now you're gonna fill that gap in so\n[502 - 505] take some paper cut out a square\n[505 - 511] rectangular shape and you're gonna glue\n[511 - 520] the inside of the Hat like this\n[523 - 523] and then Pat that down inside and then\n[523 - 533] you can't see through anymore like that\n[536 - 536] now what you're gonna do is you're gonna\n[536 - 538] make the airholes for that so take some\n[538 - 541] paper and draw six circles and put dark\n[541 - 545] dots in the middle of each one and then\n[545 - 552] cut them out\n[554 - 554] once you have them all cut out take some\n[554 - 557] glue glue the bottom of them and paste\n[557 - 574] them on in these areas on the Hat\n[577 - 577] now we're gonna make the very top of the\n[577 - 581] Hat so take some paper cut out cut out a\n[581 - 584] strip about this big I actually think I\n[584 - 587] made it a little bit too long take some\n[587 - 590] glue glue the end and make a circle\n[590 - 593] shape about this size and glue both ends\n[593 - 600] together once you have that done take a\n[600 - 602] piece of paper cut out a circle about\n[602 - 609] this big take the other piece glue the\n[609 - 614] bottom put that on top and then once you\n[614 - 619] get that on glue the other side you\n[619 - 620] might want to use a little bit more glue\n[620 - 622] than I did here and then put that on the\n[622 - 627] top right there now this is the point\n[627 - 630] when you can put logos on here here here\n[630 - 633] I used EC and a bunch of them but you\n[633 - 635] can do anything you want and also you\n[635 - 637] can go online print this sticker off\n[637 - 641] glue the back and put it on the brim to\n[641 - 644] give it a more realistic look and there\n[644 - 647] you go there's your hat if you have any\n[647 - 649] questions you can message me and I'll\n[649 - 652] answer anything if you want you can also\n[652 - 654] put your video of your hat as a video\n[654 - 657] response to this I'd love to see it good\n[657 - 659] luck\n\n```\n"

(Greeting)\n[5 - 7] The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to make a paper hat. (Overview)\n[7 - 10] The first step is to draw three shapes that look like this. (Method)\n[10 - 13] The first shape you draw is going to have a curve. (Method)\n[13 - 19] The second shape is going to be a little bit less curved but have a slant going up with a small slit. (Method)\n[19 - 23] The third shape is going to be the smallest piece and less curved on the edge. (Method)\n[27 - 31] After you have this drawing, cut each one out. (Method)\n[31 - 35] You will have three shapes after cutting them out. (Description)\n[35 - 37] Take one of the shapes and put it on a white piece of paper to trace around. (Method)\n[39 - 41] You are making two of each shape to ensure they are the same size. (Explanation)\n[45 - 47] If the shapes are not the same size, the hat will not fit together correctly. (Explanation)\n[56 - 58] Once you have all those traced, take some scissors and cut each one out. (Method)\n[63 - 66] This is the time to color them if you want to. (Supplementary)\n[67 - 71] After cutting them out, take one of the shapes and draw lines around the edge. (Method)\n[73 - 76] These lines represent the seams of the hat. (Explanation)\n[76 - 79] You can also use a dotted line for these seams if you prefer. (Supplementary)\n[90 - 92] Make sure that for the two largest pieces, the slant is going down on one side and going up on the other side. (Method)\n[94 - 98] This creates a mirror image effect. (Explanation)\n[100 - 103] Once you have them all drawn on, take these two pieces and tape them together. (Method)\n[105 - 107] Use a piece of tape on the back to hold them together. (Method)\n[109 - 115] You are now starting to put the hat together. (Method)\n[115 - 117] Take another piece of tape and put it on the back to secure them together. (Method)\n[119 - 122] You will be doing this for each piece. (Method)\n[124 - 126] Make sure you don't tape too close to the top to allow for adjustments. (Supplementary)\n[133 - 138] The next two pieces are the smallest ones, which should be placed on each side symmetrically. (Method)\n[142 - 145] If you don't put them together in the right order, the hat will not come out right. (Explanation)\n[154 - 173] Attach the other small piece to the other side. (Method)\n[175 - 179] For the two largest pieces, ensure the slants are in a mirror image again. (Method)\n[185 - 191] Continue taping on the back and putting them together as you have been doing. (Method)\n[204 - 207] These two last pieces are usually the most difficult to put together because everything is crowded. (Explanation)\n[231 - 233] If you have a gap at the top, that's completely fine. (Explanation)\n[245 - 247] If you have extra tape, you can cut it off with scissors. (Method)\n[248 - 252] Don't worry about the gap at the top because it will be covered up later. (Explanation)\n[254 - 256] Take some thin cardboard to use for the hat. (Method)\n[259 - 262] You can use any cardboard you want, such as Ritz cardboard. (Supplementary)\n[269 - 272] Make about six tabs, but you only really need four. (Method)\n[279 - 281] Take some tape and bend it to make it easier to attach. (Method)\n[287 - 292] Tape around the entire hat to make it more sturdy and give it a round shape. (Method)\n[299 - 303] Keep taping around the top and bottom to ensure they are secure. (Method)\n[305 - 307] You may notice you can see through the white hat to the cardboard, but that's fine. (Explanation)\n[317 - 322] Make the brim by putting the hat down and drawing a half circle. (Method)\n[328 - 331] Draw lightly in case you mess up so you can erase it. (Supplementary)\n[341 - 345] Once you have it how you like, darken the lines. (Method)\n[367 - 370] Cut out the brim with scissors. (Method)\n[370 - 373] You can color the brim if you want to. (Supplementary)\n[376 - 378] Draw lines on the brim to represent the seams. (Method)\n[389 - 392] You can also use dotted lines for the seams if you prefer. (Supplementary)\n[398 - 401] Before reaching the end, leave an area blank. (Method)\n[407 - 412] Take some cardboard and trace around the paper for the brim. (Method)\n[414 - 420] It's okay if the cardboard is a little too small, just ensure it's not too small. (Explanation)\n[422 - 425] Cut out the cardboard to make the brim more stiff. (Method)\n[430 - 437] Glue the cardboard and attach the paper brim onto it. (Method)\n[446 - 457] If you have any writing on the brim, trace around it and cut it out. (Method)\n[460 - 462] Put the cut piece over the writing so it is not visible. (Method)\n[469 - 475] Make sure the shape of the brim matches the shape of the hat. (Method)\n[478 - 490] Tape the brim to the bottom of the hat to secure it. (Method)\n[502 - 505] Fill the gap in the hat by cutting out a square or rectangular shape of paper. (Method)\n[511 - 523] Glue the inside of the hat and press the paper down inside. (Method)\n[533 - 536] This will prevent seeing through the hat. (Explanation)\n[538 - 541] Make air holes by drawing six circles on paper and putting dark dots in the middle. (Method)\n[545 - 554] Cut out the circles after drawing them. (Method)\n[557 - 574] Glue the bottom of the circles and paste them onto the hat in designated areas. (Method)\n[577 - 581] To make the very top of the hat, cut out a strip of paper. (Method)\n[590 - 593] Glue the ends of the strip together to form a circle shape. (Method)\n[602 - 609] Cut out another circle of paper and glue it on top of the first circle. (Method)\n[627 - 630] You can add logos or stickers to the top of the hat for decoration. (Supplementary)\n[635 - 641] You can print stickers online and glue them to the brim for a realistic look. (Supplementary)\n[644 - 647] And there you go, there's your hat! (Conclusion)\n[647 - 649] If you have any questions, you can message me and I'll answer anything. (Miscellaneous)\n[652 - 654] You can also share a video of your hat as a response to this tutorial. (Miscellaneous)\n[657 - 659] Good luck! (Conclusion)\n\n```\n"

Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3.

Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[2 - 4] Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts on behalf of Expert Village. (Greeting)\n[4 - 8] We are going to make party hats. (Overview)\n[8 - 10] This fun party hat is made out of only three pieces of construction paper. (Description)\n[10 - 13] This is the smaller paper. (Description)\n[13 - 21] Take the smaller paper and wrap it around your head until it fits. (Method)\n[21 - 26] Tape or staple the paper to secure it. (Method)\n[32 - 37] You might want to take a special pair of scissors with fancy edges. (Supplementary)\n[37 - 42] Cut around the edge so that you have an edge that looks fancy. (Method)\n[47 - 49] If you don't have fancy scissors, you can always just tear the paper. (Supplementary)\n[49 - 51] Tearing the paper will also give you a fancy edge. (Explanation)\n[57 - 60] Before you cut out your hat, leave it open and decorate it. (Method)\n[66 - 70] You might want to write 'Happy Birthday' in crayon or use markers. (Method)\n[70 - 73] You can also use glitter and glue for decoration. (Method)\n[73 - 75] Put your hat together after decorating it. (Method)\n[78 - 82] Cut out a variety of sizes and colors of circles. (Method)\n[82 - 84] Start cutting out your circles. (Method)\n[89 - 92] Stay fairly close to the edge while cutting. (Supplementary)\n[92 - 95] It does not have to be even; that's the beauty of it. (Explanation)\n[95 - 97] Keep cutting until you have a spiraled shape. (Method)\n[101 - 103] Take the center and stretch it. (Method)\n[109 - 111] I used several pieces of yellow and several pieces of purple. (Description)\n[114 - 116] Start with a large circle of purple and a small circle of yellow. (Method)\n[122 - 128] Put them all together and staple them at the top. (Method)\n[128 - 131] Shake them out to create a fun, crazy happy birthday hat. (Conclusion)\n[134 - 136] This hat would work for a birthday party. (Overview)\n\n```\n"

Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[2 - 4] Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts on behalf of Expert Village.

Work strictly in the order below.\n\n1. Derive canonical procedure_segments\n- For every `Method` piece, convert it to <object(s)> or <action> or <action> + <object(s)>, where <action> is a single verb and <object(s)> is a single object or a list of objects. Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[21 - 23] Decorate your mash into a pirate ship using acrylic paint.

Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[3 - 6] Hi, in this video I'm going to show you how you can create an imaginative Easter bonnet with your child using simple paper mache techniques. (Greeting)\n[12 - 15] You need a balloon if you're making something like this out of an egg shape. (Method)\n[20 - 23] If you want to make an animal or a bird, you'll need a small balloon for the head and a larger balloon for the body. (Method)\n[26 - 33] Inflate the large balloon. (Method)\n[33 - 36] Sit the balloon in a saucepan or bowl so it sits securely while you're applying the strips of newspaper. (Method)\n[44 - 48] Cut newspaper into 1 by 5 inch strips. (Method)\n[48 - 50] You don't have to cut the strips exactly 1 by 5 inches; it can be approximate. (Supplementary)\n[55 - 58] You need a pot of PVA glue which has some water in it so it's running. (Method)\n[60 - 63] You need a paintbrush and a meal apron to cover your child because it can get messy. (Method)\n[69 - 71] Get your child to cover an area of the balloon with glue. (Method)\n[75 - 79] The glue should run on the balloon quite easily. (Explanation)\n[82 - 86] After covering an area of the balloon in PVA glue, apply strips running in the same direction all around the balloon. (Method)\n[95 - 98] Apply another layer of glue. (Method)\n[98 - 101] Put on the strips going in the opposite direction, overlapping slightly so there are no gaps. (Method)\n[108 - 110] Your third layer will go back to the original direction. (Method)\n[112 - 116] For the final layer, apply some kitchen towel strips or some paper towel strips. (Method)\n[122 - 126] This provides a really good base for painting. (Explanation)\n[126 - 128] This helps ensure that the print doesn't show through. (Explanation)\n[130 - 135] This provides a good base if you're wanting to put squares of tissue paper onto the balloon. (Explanation)\n[139 - 142] After about 24 hours in a really warm place, your balloon will hopefully dry so that it's very solid. (Method)\n[154 - 157] Pop the balloon and cut a circular hole in the bottom large enough for the top of the hat. (Method)\n[161 - 164] The hat should fit securely on the head. (Explanation)\n[166 - 169] If you want to make an Easter basket, cut a section out of each side leaving a handle shape down the middle. (Method)\n[177 - 180] Your child could fill the basket with things that they've made. (Method)\n[180 - 184] You can use homemade daffodils, decoupage eggs, and some tissue paper shred. (Method)\n[191 - 197] If you're interested in making one of the animals, you need some tissue paper shred for their fur or for their coat. (Method)\n[204 - 209] To help you sit the head on top of the body, use some duct tape to make some crisscross shapes at the bottom of the head. (Method)\n[214 - 216] Stick the head on top of the body so that it's secure. (Method)\n[218 - 221] You don't want the head to fall off during the Easter bonnet parade. (Explanation)\n[228 - 233] At my website wwlp.com, there are three kits available: a chick kit, a rabbit kit, and a lamb kit. (Miscellaneous)\n[238 - 244] Each kit comes with all materials that you'll need to make an Easter bonnet as well as the bonnet and a list of instructions to help you go through it step by step. (Description)\n[248 - 250] If you have any questions or any ideas that you want to discuss, please get in touch. (Conclusion)\n[250 - 254] Thank you for watching. (Greeting)\n\n```\n"

Work strictly in the order below.\n\n1. Derive canonical procedure_segments\n- For every `Method` piece, convert it to <object(s)> or <action> or <action> + <object(s)>, where <action> is a single verb and <object(s)> is a single object or a list of objects. Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[3 - 7] Hi, I'm Phyllis Cambria, the co-owner of Party Plans Plus.

Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.

8] hello and welcome back to the insane\n[8 - 10] knitters the YouTube video channel this\n[10 - 14] is going to be a demonstration of a flat\n[14 - 16] hat it's a flat hat you might ask well a\n[16 - 19] lot of hats are knit in the round on a\n[19 - 21] cable needle and they they're you know\n[21 - 23] you just knit them in a circle and then\n[23 - 25] you decrease to the top and you finish\n[25 - 27] it that way a flat hat is knit on\n[27 - 30] straight needles like this with just a\n[30 - 33] large piece of fabric and a lot of\n[33 - 35] people make hats this way it does\n[35 - 37] involve some seaming and I'll show you\n[37 - 41] that but what I'm using here is really\n[41 - 43] big needles and really thick yarn this\n[43 - 47] is called encore mega and on a size 15\n[47 - 48] needle it gives you two stitches per\n[48 - 51] inch and that's just something I'm using\n[51 - 54] right now and I'll tell you why it makes\n[54 - 56] a quick it's a very quick knit just\n[56 - 59] quick quick turn it up and it it's very\n[59 - 61] thick and you only generally need one\n[61 - 64] skein to do this you can use two it\n[64 - 67] tells you on the label\n[67 - 70] how many yards it is and it's this is\n[71 - 73] sixty four yards on and I'm using a\n[73 - 76] smaller needle than it calls for so I'm\n[76 - 77] getting a little more yardage out of\n[77 - 80] this to knit with but that's neither\n[80 - 81] here nor there you can use any yarn you\n[81 - 83] want for this I'm just using the thick\n[83 - 85] yarn and the big needles too to show you\n[85 - 88] because it's easier um when you want to\n[88 - 90] make a flat hat uh\n[90 - 93] like I said you is a thick skein of yarn\n[93 - 95] to give me about two stitches per inch\n[95 - 98] because it's it's a quick knit and I\n[98 - 101] find it easier but you can do this with\n[101 - 102] baby yarn you can do this with any yarn\n[102 - 105] you want as long as you measure properly\n[105 - 107] and that is really the thing you want to\n[107 - 110] cast on enough stitches on your needles\n[110 - 115] to make the length as high as you want\n[115 - 118] the hat to be so if you need the Hat to\n[118 - 121] be 10 inches high you know so you've got\n[121 - 123] good six inches of coverage on your hat\n[123 - 126] then you want to cast on enough stitches\n[126 - 131] because this is going to be however\n[131 - 134] however why it is is going to be how it\n[134 - 138] sits on your head so and then you want\n[138 - 141] to knit - however you however long you\n[141 - 143] want it to be around generally the most\n[143 - 146] average hat is the average person's head\n[146 - 149] is about 20 to 22 inches you know the\n[149 - 151] kids are obviously smaller than that and\n[151 - 153] people come in different sizes so you\n[153 - 157] just want to knit as long as you want\n[157 - 159] your hat to be around and I'll show you\n[159 - 163] why what I have done here is I've knit\n[163 - 165] to the point to where I want to bind off\n[165 - 168] okay I think this is about 12 inches so\n[168 - 170] it's going to make a small hat and now\n[170 - 172] I'm ready to bind off so I'm going to go\n[172 - 173] ahead and do that and I'll come back in\n[173 - 175] a minute when I'm bound off and I'll\n[175 - 177] show you what and we're back\n[177 - 179] okay I have bound off this piece of\n[179 - 182] fabric to the last stitch and I'll show\n[182 - 185] you what to do now\n[185 - 188] we've got our last stitch here and you\n[188 - 192] want to finish that up no but you want\n[193 - 194] it the thing is is we're going to seam\n[194 - 196] this now so you want to instead of just\n[196 - 198] cutting this off really close and\n[198 - 200] binding it off that way you want to\n[200 - 205] leave a long piece long piece of tail\n[205 - 206] yarn here because we're going to use\n[206 - 210] this piece to sew up the Hat so you want\n[210 - 213] to leave really long tail to sew with so\n[213 - 217] okay I'm gonna leave let's say that much\n[217 - 224] okay and then we're gonna cut this\n[226 - 226] and then we're gonna pull it through\n[226 - 229] okay so there we go that's our last\n[229 - 231] stitch and we're pulling our tail yarn\n[231 - 234] through and we're gonna there we go now\n[234 - 236] we're bound off completely here okay\n[236 - 239] there we go now this is the piece of\n[239 - 243] fabric that I knitted and what we're\n[243 - 246] going to do is we're going to take a\n[246 - 250] yarn needle if you don't have a yarn\n[250 - 253] needle they come in various kinds this\n[253 - 255] is a large one so because I'm using\n[255 - 262] really big yarn here this is the piece I\n[262 - 265] knitted okay here's the the cast on edge\n[265 - 267] this is where I started knitting and\n[268 - 270] then I knit it however long I want my\n[270 - 273] hat to be generally this one's about 12\n[273 - 278] inches and but you know like I said\n[278 - 282] normally you'd knit however long two to\n[282 - 284] make it or whoever you're knitting it\n[284 - 287] for measuring heads is kind of weird but\n[287 - 291] you can do it just you know or you can\n[291 - 292] take your best guess like I said the\n[292 - 295] average hat the average size is about 20\n[295 - 299] to 22 inches depending on on the person\n[299 - 303] you're knitting for so here's our our\n[303 - 305] cast on edge this is where we started\n[305 - 307] Inc this is our cast off edge where we\n[307 - 309] stop knitting and this is what we're\n[309 - 313] going to do we're going to sew the cast\n[313 - 314] on edge\n[314 - 317] to the cast-off edge the bind off and\n[317 - 320] the bind on we're going to sew those\n[320 - 321] together and you're going to end up with\n[321 - 324] this two looking thing okay like that so\n[324 - 327] you want to take your really long tail\n[327 - 330] that you left you also can use another\n[330 - 334] piece of yarn to do this you know just\n[334 - 336] if you want you can use a different size\n[336 - 339] of yarn I prefer to use the yarn that I\n[339 - 341] used to sew the Hat so that way it\n[341 - 347] doesn't show if it gets pulled apart\n[347 - 348] okay so here we are we have our yarn\n[348 - 353] needle and our yarn and we're going to\n[353 - 357] sew these edges together now you can see\n[357 - 359] here where your yarn where you bound off\n[359 - 361] right there and then you can see the\n[361 - 364] edge over here so I generally oh and\n[364 - 365] then that's another thing to see this\n[365 - 366] pattern I just this is garter stitch\n[366 - 368] it's just all knit stitches it's nice\n[368 - 370] for hats it's thick it's comfortable but\n[370 - 372] you can use any pattern you want you\n[372 - 374] don't have to be you don't have to use\n[374 - 375] garter stitch I know someone who does\n[376 - 377] these in ribbing you can do it every\n[377 - 381] pattern you want just remember that one\n[381 - 383] side will be inside on the person's head\n[383 - 385] and the other side will be on the\n[385 - 387] outside so just keep that in mind with\n[387 - 389] your pattern but this is just simple\n[389 - 390] garter stitch it's all it's knit every\n[390 - 392] row just because it works for\n[392 - 395] demonstration purposes and also it helps\n[395 - 399] me line up what I'm doing here so see\n[399 - 400] there's I'm lining up the little rows\n[400 - 404] there and now you just take your yarn\n[404 - 411] needle and you pick up in between the\n[411 - 413] bind off stitches there's these little\n[413 - 417] ladders see those right in between each\n[417 - 420] of these stitches you can go in and pick\n[420 - 423] up that little that little ladder inside\n[423 - 426] in it and that really helps you a lot\n[426 - 428] when you're sewing and so what we're\n[428 - 431] going to do is just seam all the way\n[431 - 433] across or I'll show you a couple\n[433 - 435] stitches how I do it there's lots of\n[435 - 438] ways to do this but this is how I do it\n[438 - 441] and so I just come over and I pick up\n[441 - 446] the corner first just to secure that\n[446 - 452] just to secure them together okay so now\n[452 - 454] they're there they're secured they're\n[454 - 457] sewn together and then I come in and I\n[457 - 463] pick up both sides sorry I bump the\n[463 - 465] camera pick up both sides of this stitch\n[465 - 470] and both sides of this one and pull that\n[470 - 474] through there we go that's sewn together\n[474 - 476] this making a flat hat does make a big\n[476 - 479] seam down the side and that can be\n[479 - 480] uncomfortable for some people when they\n[480 - 485] wear stuff but it's just a side effect\n[485 - 487] of what this pattern you know of making\n[487 - 490] a flat hat so and then that's it I just\n[490 - 493] go back and forth I cut this is called\n[493 - 495] kind of a whip stitch you just go back\n[495 - 500] and forth and sew it up all the way up\n[500 - 502] up the sides and you want to make sure\n[502 - 506] that you get just about every stitch so\n[506 - 510] that way you don't have big holes when\n[510 - 514] you when the person puts this hat on so\n[514 - 517] see I'm picking up both legs of this\n[517 - 520] stitch both legs of that stitch and I'm\n[520 - 526] just coming through just like this okay\n[526 - 528] and you see how that's being seamed\n[528 - 531] together there it's making this little\n[531 - 535] making this little line down there down\n[535 - 537] the Knitting I'll show you what to do\n[537 - 546] with that in a minute so there we go\n[548 - 548] see that's another reason I like to use\n[548 - 551] the same color of yarn because this way\n[551 - 557] it doesn't show very very much\n[559 - 559] see when you can tell there's a scene\n[559 - 561] there but you can't really see where the\n[561 - 564] yarn is because I use the same yarn now\n[564 - 565] if I used a different color you could\n[565 - 569] really see so pick up both legs of that\n[569 - 573] stitch and both legs of the next one and\n[573 - 576] come come through\n[576 - 579] and I will see you in a minute when I\n[579 - 581] get this seemed up in Italy\n[581 - 583] okay I'm back I've got this all seem\n[583 - 586] down the side now okay\n[586 - 587] so now I have this tube see this tube\n[587 - 590] thing it's a it's like a it's a tube\n[590 - 594] okay and it's not a hat yet but it will\n[594 - 596] be okay so I'm gonna finish up this last\n[596 - 600] stitch here just like that this is a\n[600 - 602] little tail where we started to knit\n[602 - 605] remember now this is the part where you\n[605 - 607] make your hat okay you're going to\n[607 - 611] basically stitch up one of the one of\n[611 - 615] the sides here and that's going to close\n[615 - 618] one end of the tube and kind of make a\n[618 - 621] little hat shape like this okay like\n[621 - 623] that so it doesn't look like a hat now\n[623 - 625] but when I get this all sewn and I pull\n[625 - 628] it really tight it'll make a little hat\n[628 - 630] like that and you said you know it's not\n[630 - 632] the prettiest thing in the world but it\n[632 - 634] does work very well and then you can\n[634 - 638] fold this up and and you have a hat for\n[638 - 642] whomever you're making it for this is\n[642 - 646] the part where their head goes in there\n[646 - 649] you go you can fold that up and there's\n[649 - 651] the top of the hat so that's how you\n[651 - 653] make a flat hat so let's go I'll come\n[653 - 655] back just a minute when I get this top\n[655 - 658] zone and it's over the top you're going\n[658 - 660] to instead of going back and forth like\n[660 - 663] we did with this loose with the whip\n[663 - 665] stitching you're kind of going to do the\n[665 - 667] same thing only you do it on both sides\n[668 - 670] so there's where I came out so I'm going\n[670 - 673] to go in here like that\n[673 - 675] pick up that because this is a different\n[675 - 677] edge so it's going to look a little a\n[677 - 680] little different because this is a side\n[680 - 682] now instead of the bind off edge so\n[682 - 684] you're going to go so you came out here\n[684 - 686] and then you're going to go back on this\n[686 - 689] side and over here like that you make in\n[689 - 692] kind of a criss cross one two three four\n[692 - 693] instead of going back and forth like\n[693 - 698] that so you just go just like this and\n[698 - 700] I'll see you in just a second when I get\n[700 - 701] this done\n[701 - 703] okay I've reached the last stitch now\n[703 - 705] and these these are all stitched and I\n[705 - 706] went back and forth back and forth and\n[706 - 708] now I'm at the last stitch I'm going to\n[708 - 711] pull it through and you didn't you don't\n[711 - 712] want to seen this too tightly because\n[712 - 714] this is what you're going to do now now\n[714 - 717] you're gonna pull see you pull that\n[717 - 719] really tight like that and see how it\n[719 - 722] squishes like that okay you pull it\n[722 - 723] really tight and then what I do is I\n[723 - 727] take my needle and I just kind of wedge\n[727 - 731] it through again just just because guess\n[731 - 734] that little gives it a little extra\n[734 - 738] tightening okay just like that and you\n[738 - 740] can do it again if you want just to use\n[740 - 743] up some of the slack on your on your\n[743 - 745] needle there or some of the extra yarn\n[745 - 748] okay there you go and you know one more\n[748 - 752] time why not we're here so there you go\n[752 - 755] you pull it tight now you weave in your\n[755 - 760] ends\n[762 - 762] there's an end and then you pull it\n[762 - 765] inside out and there you go you have a\n[765 - 770] hat here just a flat hat\n[775 - 775] tada you made a hat yay Congrats\n[775 - 778] here's your flat head with your ins bulb\n[778 - 781] in and there's the broom you can roll it\n[781 - 782] up or they can just wear it straight\n[782 - 785] they want but there it is\n[785 - 789] and that's what the top looks like\n[790 - 790] like I said it's not the prettiest thing\n[790 - 792] in the world but it's good it's\n[792 - 793] functional and you can use whatever\n[793 - 798] pattern you want and in it however you\n[798 - 798] like\n[798 - 802] there you go but\n\n```\n"

Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[8 - 10] Hello and welcome back to the Insane Knitters YouTube video channel. (Greeting)\n[10 - 14] This video is going to be a demonstration of how to make a flat hat. (Overview)\n[14 - 16] A lot of hats are knit in the round on a cable needle. (Overview)\n[27 - 30] A flat hat is knit on straight needles with a large piece of fabric. (Overview)\n[35 - 37] A flat hat involves some seaming. (Overview)\n[41 - 43] I am using really big needles and really thick yarn called Encore Mega. (Method)\n[47 - 48] I am using a size 15 needle which gives me two stitches per inch. (Method)\n[54 - 56] Using thick yarn makes for a quick knit. (Explanation)\n[61 - 64] You generally only need one skein to make a flat hat. (Method)\n[80 - 81] You can use any yarn you want for this project as long as you measure properly. (Method)\n[107 - 110] Cast on enough stitches to make the length of the hat as high as you want it to be. (Method)\n[115 - 118] If you need the hat to be 10 inches high, cast on enough stitches for that height. (Method)\n[146 - 149] The average person's head is about 20 to 22 inches in circumference. (Description)\n[157 - 159] Knit as long as you want your hat to be around. (Method)\n[163 - 165] I have knit to the point where I want to bind off. (Method)\n[170 - 172] I am ready to bind off the stitches. (Method)\n[205 - 206] Leave a long piece of tail yarn when binding off to sew up the hat. (Method)\n[226 - 226] Cut the yarn after leaving a long tail. (Method)\n[229 - 231] Pull the tail yarn through the last stitch to secure it. (Method)\n[246 - 250] Take a yarn needle to sew the edges of the hat together. (Method)\n[265 - 267] The cast on edge is where I started knitting. (Description)\n[307 - 309] The cast off edge is where I stopped knitting. (Description)\n[313 - 314] Sew the cast on edge to the cast off edge to form the hat. (Method)\n[327 - 330] Use the long tail yarn to sew the edges together. (Method)\n[334 - 336] You can use a different piece of yarn to sew the hat if desired. (Supplementary)\n[548 - 551] Use the same color yarn to avoid visible seams. (Supplementary)\n[517 - 520] Pick up both legs of the stitches when sewing to avoid holes. (Method)\n[476 - 479] This method creates a seam down the side of the hat. (Explanation)\n[722 - 723] Pull the yarn tight to close the top of the hat. (Method)\n[755 - 760] Weave in the ends of the yarn to finish the hat. (Method)\n[765 - 770] You have now made a flat hat. (Conclusion)\n[782 - 785] The hat can be rolled up or worn straight. (Description)\n[793 - 798] You can use any pattern you want for the hat. (Supplementary)\n\n```\n"

Derive canonical procedure_segments\n- For every `Method` piece, convert it to <object(s)> or <action> or <action> + <object(s)>, where <action> is a single verb and <object(s)> is a single object or a list of objects. Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[4 - 7] We are going to be making a paper hat. (Overview)\n[7 - 11] You will first need to fold the paper in half. (Method)\n[11 - 19] The fold doesn't have to be too accurate. (Supplementary)\n[19 - 25] Fold the paper in half.

(Method)\n[42 - 48] Fold over the top pieces like you would a paper airplane. (Method)\n[48 - 56] This is to make the paper hat. (Explanation)\n[76 - 81] You can fill it with chips or whatever you want. (Method)\n[89 - 101] To make it look a little neater, you can fold in the corner pieces.

    "content": "\nYou are analyzing a tutorial video for How to Make a Paper Hat.\n\nFrom a list of atomic information pieces, derive the procedure segments and the procedural scope of each piece. Work strictly in the order below.\n\n1. Derive canonical procedure_segments\n- For every `Method` piece, convert it to <object(s)> or <action> or <action> + <object(s)>, where <action> is a single verb and <object(s)> is a single object or a list of objects. Do not include any adverbs.\n- Include the task as one of the procedure_segments (e.g., `make muffins`)\nExample:\n- `Whisk the eggs for 30 s` \u2192 [`whisk eggs`]\n- `Add the beaten eggs to the mixture` \u2192 [`add eggs`]\n- `Add 1 cup of white chocolate chips.` \u2192 [`add white chocolate chips`]\n- Use each of these canonical phrases as a unique procedure_segment identifier.\n\n\n2. Label the procedural scope of every piece\n- The `procedure_segments` field is the smallest set of identifiers that fully covers the scope of the piece.\n- Usually one segment; may be a set if the statement spans multiple steps.\n- If the piece itself is a `Method`, its procedure_segments should normally be the single canonical action+objects segment you just created in Step 1.\n- For content types `Description`, `Explanation`, and `Supplementary`, select the procedure segments that are most relevant to the piece.\n- For content types `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous`, leave the field empty.\n- Always reuse an existing identifier rather than creating synonyms.\n- All content types except `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` should have at least one procedure segment that is relevant to the piece.\n\n3. Validation checklist (run before returning)\na.\tEvery content is atomic: deleting any word breaks comprehension.\nb.\tEvery `method` appears verb-first and has at least one object.\nc.\tNo dangling pronouns. \nd.  Every `procedure_segment` referenced actually exists.\ne.  Every piece has at least one `procedure_segment`, except for `Greeting`, `Overview`, `Conclusion`, and `Miscellaneous` pieces.\n\nThe list of atomic information pieces is as follows:\n```\n[11 - 15] You can use the technique to make a top hat of any size. (Overview)\n[15 - 23] Use a cardboard tube, construction paper, poster board, or any material that is stiff enough. (Method)\n[26 - 31] Start by drawing around the cardboard tube at the bottom. (Method)\n[31 - 38] Add some tabs so that you can glue it onto the tube. (Method)\n[44 - 53] After cutting it out, it looks like this. (Description)\n[66 - 71] Glue the tabs on first so later you can cover them up. (Method)\n[71 - 81] It takes a few minutes for the glue to dry. (Explanation)\n[84 - 87] While waiting for the glue to dry, draw around the bottom of the tube. (Method)\n[87 - 93] Place the tube and draw a circle around it. (Method)\n[93 - 98] For the brim, draw a bigger circle around that. (Method)\n[111 - 116] Cut the circle out and make a big X in the middle. (Method)\n[116 - 121] Cut along the lines of the X. (Method)\n[126 - 132] Bend up the triangles created by the X. (Method)\n[132 - 140] Put glue on the outside of the triangles. (Method)\n[143 - 147] Place the triangles on the inside of the tube. (Method)\n[158 - 164] Press the triangles down with your finger so that they glue on. (Method)\n[164 - 172] Measure the tube and cut a paper strip around it to cover it up. (Method)\n[172 - 176] Cut a little band that is a rectangle. (Method)\n[176 - 180] Make the band as wide or as narrow as you want. (Supplementary)\n[180 - 184] Cut strips to make the stripes. (Method)\n[184 - 187] Put the stripes on before gluing the band on. (Method)\n[190 - 193] Add stars and glitter if you want. (Method)\n[195 - 198] You can make it any way you want.
