Slice thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces.\n2. Heat a pan on medium and add a tiny bit of olive oil.\n3. Add bacon to the pan and render the fat until crispy.\n4. Boil water and add a tablespoon of kosher salt.\n5. Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\n6. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl.\n7. Whisk grated cheese into the egg mixture.\n8. Add fresh ground black pepper to the egg and cheese mixture.\n9. Add a quarter cup of boiling pasta water to the egg mixture to temper it.\n10. Cook spaghetti until slightly al dente.\n11. Turn off the heat and drain most of the bacon fat, leaving about two tablespoons.\n12. Add cooked spaghetti to the pan with bacon fat.\n13. Add egg and cheese mixture to the spaghetti, stirring gently to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n14. If needed, use reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\n15. Plate the pasta and garnish with more cheese and crispy bacon.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`\"Slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\"`; `\"Turn this pan on to medium heat.\"`; `\"Break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy.\"`; `\"Season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.\"`; `\"Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\"`; `\"I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.\"`; `\"Whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.\"`; `\"Put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.\"`; `\"Take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs. Quickly whisk that in.\"`; `\"We'll cook this spaghetti about 10 minutes in this pot, just slightly al dente.\"`; `\"Turn off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so.\"`; `\"Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat.\"`; `\"Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.\"`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy carbonara sauce without scrambling the eggs. Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible. The combination of cheeses adds depth of flavor. Tempering the egg mixture with hot pasta water prevents the eggs from scrambling when mixed with the hot pasta. The rendered bacon fat adds flavor and helps emulsify the sauce.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`\"Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale... but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.\"`; `\"Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.\"`; `\"Carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.\"`; `\"We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end.\"`; `\"The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs.\"`\n- **Overall Tips**: - Use thick-cut bacon or pancetta for best results.\n- Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano are preferred cheeses.\n- Avoid adding olive oil to the pasta water; it's unnecessary.\n- Use pasta water to adjust sauce consistency if needed.\n- Be gentle when mixing the egg mixture with the pasta to avoid scrambling.\n- If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of pasta water to loosen it.\n- Use a pan that retains heat well to help cook the egg mixture gently.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`\"Thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.\"`; `\"Make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.\"`; `\"We're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it.\"`; `\"If it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.\"`\n"

Chop bacon into small pieces. 2. Separate egg yolks from whites and set aside the yolks. 3. Grate pecorino romano cheese and mix it with the egg yolks. 4. Add pepper to the egg and cheese mixture. 5. Cook spaghetti in salted boiling water. 6. Cook bacon in a pan until crispy, then turn off the heat and let it cool slightly. 7. Add a bit of pasta water to the egg and cheese mixture. 8. Transfer cooked spaghetti directly from the pot to the bacon pan. 9. Mix the spaghetti with the bacon and then add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring to combine. 10.

Bacon is used instead of guanciale for flavor. Egg yolks and cheese create a rich sauce that is thickened by the heat of the pasta. Pasta water is added to help emulsify the sauce and achieve the desired creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink.`\n- **Overall Tips**: 1. Use guanciale instead of bacon for authentic carbonara. 2. Be careful not to overcook the egg-based sauce by letting the pan cool slightly before adding the egg mixture. 3. Reserve pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency. 4. Avoid breaking spaghetti to maintain its texture. 5. Finish with extra cheese and pepper for added flavor.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`If you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish.`; `If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw.`; `Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months.`; `If you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water.`\n"

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: To make an authentic spaghetti carbonara using traditional ingredients and techniques.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish.`; `I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe.`\n- **Overall Objects**: Pasta, guanciale (or pancetta), pecorino romano cheese, free-range organic eggs, black pepper, optional garlic, salt, water.\n\t- **Overall Objects Quotes**:`So first up guys, you only need five ingredients.`; `Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, free-range organic egg.`; `Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A classic spaghetti carbonara with a creamy sauce achieved through emulsification, featuring golden guanciale, pecorino cheese, and a perfect balance of flavors.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Look at that guys, look at that. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper.`; `Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino.`; `That my friends, is a thing of joy.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Prepare the ingredients: guanciale, pecorino romano, eggs, pasta, black pepper, and optionally garlic. 2. Boil water with a small amount of salt and twist the pasta into it to prevent sticking. Cook for 8 minutes. 3. Remove the skin from the guanciale and chop it into half-centimeter chunks. 4. Start with a cold pan, add guanciale, and heat to medium-high to render the fat. 5. Crack garlic and add to the pan to infuse flavor. 6. Crush black peppercorns, sieve to separate the hotter inner part, and add to the pan. 7. Crack eggs into a bowl, add pecorino, and whisk. 8. Once guanciale is golden, remove garlic, turn off the heat, and add pasta with some cooking water to the pan. 9. Stir to emulsify the fat and water, then add the egg mixture while tossing. 10. Finish with more black pepper and pecorino before serving.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Grab the pasta by two hands. Twist it into the water.`; `I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale.`; `The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `Crack it. Get a little sieve.`; `I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that.`; `Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan.`; `As we toss, we add some more liquid.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The cold pan allows the fat from the guanciale to render slowly, enhancing flavor. Twisting the pasta prevents it from sticking. Using a small amount of salt in the water balances the saltiness from the cheese and guanciale. Sieving the peppercorns ensures the hotter inner part is used, which is ideal for carbonara. Emulsifying the fat with pasta water creates a creamy sauce without using cream.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `By twisting it, it won't stick together.`; `Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty.`; `This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter.`; `That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for authenticity, but pancetta or bacon can be substituted. Pecorino romano is traditional, but parmesan is commonly used. The technique and timing are crucial for achieving the right texture. Avoid frying the eggs to prevent them from scrambling. Serve immediately for best taste.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles.`; `The cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing.`\n"

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: To demonstrate how to make authentic Pasta Carbonara without common mistakes.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`I show you how to make the real Carbonara.`; `Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why.`\n- **Overall Objects**: Boiling water, salt, spaghettoni pasta, guanciale or pancetta, olive oil, eggs, parmesan or pecorino cheese, pepper.\n\t- **Overall Objects Quotes**:`Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt.`; `And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta.In this case, it's sort of spaghettoni, the biggest size of spaghetti.`; `Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek.`; `You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here.`; `And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan.`; `And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.`; `So we put a little bit of parmesan.In Roma, they use also pecorino cheese, which is a cheese to be grated.`; `Abundant pepper.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A creamy and authentic Pasta Carbonara dish, made without cream, featuring perfectly coated pasta with a rich egg and cheese sauce, flavored with guanciale and pepper.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`And this is the carbonara.`; `And this is the real carbonara.The only one.And it's exactly how it should be.Creamy, without adding cream because this is the usual thing.`; `Like this is just fantastic.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Boil water and add salt at a ratio of 10 grams per liter. Add spaghettoni to the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Do not add oil.\n2. Cut guanciale into chunks and cook it in a pan with olive oil until it releases fat.\n3. Beat two egg yolks in a bowl and add grated parmesan or pecorino cheese and abundant pepper.\n4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with guanciale, allowing it to cool slightly.\n5. Mix the pasta with the egg mixture, ensuring the pasta is not too hot to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n6. Serve with additional parmesan or pecorino and a touch of pepper for decoration.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt.`; `And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta.`; `While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please.`; `Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek.`; `And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan.`; `Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce.`; `And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.`; `To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it.`; `So we put a little bit of parmesan.`; `Abundant pepper.`; `So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that.`; `And now we stir it like this.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The salt in the water seasons the pasta as it cooks. Guanciale is used for its tender and flavorful qualities, which are essential for authentic Carbonara. The eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce without the need for cream, which is traditionally not used. Cooling the pasta slightly before adding the egg mixture prevents the eggs from scrambling, ensuring a creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why.`; `No oil, because you don't need it.`; `And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for the best flavor, but pancetta can be a substitute. Avoid adding cream to maintain authenticity. If the guanciale releases too much fat, you can absorb some with a paper towel. Ensure the pasta is not too hot when mixing with the egg to prevent scrambling. Add cheese and pepper as a final touch for flavor and presentation.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n"

Chop bacon into small pieces. 2. Separate egg yolks from whites and set aside the yolks. 3. Grate pecorino romano cheese and mix it with the egg yolks. 4. Add pepper to the egg and cheese mixture. 5. Cook spaghetti in salted boiling water. 6. Cook bacon in a pan until crispy, then turn off the heat and let it cool slightly. 7. Add a bit of pasta water to the egg and cheese mixture. 8. Transfer cooked spaghetti directly from the pot to the bacon pan. 9. Mix the spaghetti with the bacon and then add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring to combine. 10.

Bacon is used instead of guanciale for flavor. Egg yolks and cheese create a rich sauce that is thickened by the heat of the pasta. Pasta water is added to help emulsify the sauce and achieve the desired creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink.`\n- **Overall Tips**: 1. Use guanciale instead of bacon for authentic carbonara. 2. Be careful not to overcook the egg-based sauce by letting the pan cool slightly before adding the egg mixture. 3. Reserve pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency. 4. Avoid breaking spaghetti to maintain its texture. 5. Finish with extra cheese and pepper for added flavor.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`If you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish.`; `If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw.`; `Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months.`; `If you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water.`\n"

Slice thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces.\n2. Heat a pan on medium and add a tiny bit of olive oil.\n3. Add bacon to the pan and render the fat until crispy.\n4. Boil water and add a tablespoon of kosher salt.\n5. Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\n6. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl.\n7. Whisk grated cheese into the egg mixture.\n8. Add fresh ground black pepper to the egg and cheese mixture.\n9. Add a quarter cup of boiling pasta water to the egg mixture to temper it.\n10. Cook spaghetti until slightly al dente.\n11. Turn off the heat and drain most of the bacon fat, leaving about two tablespoons.\n12. Add cooked spaghetti to the pan with bacon fat.\n13. Add egg and cheese mixture to the spaghetti, stirring gently to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n14. If needed, use reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\n15. Plate the pasta and garnish with more cheese and crispy bacon.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`\"Slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\"`; `\"Turn this pan on to medium heat.\"`; `\"Break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy.\"`; `\"Season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.\"`; `\"Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\"`; `\"I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.\"`; `\"Whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.\"`; `\"Put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.\"`; `\"Take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs.

Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.\"`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy carbonara sauce without scrambling the eggs. Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible. The combination of cheeses adds depth of flavor. Tempering the egg mixture with hot pasta water prevents the eggs from scrambling when mixed with the hot pasta. The rendered bacon fat adds flavor and helps emulsify the sauce.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`\"Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale... but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.\"`; `\"Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.\"`; `\"Carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.\"`; `\"We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end.\"`; `\"The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs.\"`\n- **Overall Tips**: - Use thick-cut bacon or pancetta for best results.\n- Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano are preferred cheeses.\n- Avoid adding olive oil to the pasta water; it's unnecessary.\n- Use pasta water to adjust sauce consistency if needed.\n- Be gentle when mixing the egg mixture with the pasta to avoid scrambling.\n- If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of pasta water to loosen it.\n- Use a pan that retains heat well to help cook the egg mixture gently.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`\"Thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.\"`; `\"Make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.\"`; `\"We're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it.\"`; `\"If it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.\"`\n"

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: To make an authentic spaghetti carbonara using traditional ingredients and techniques.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish.`; `I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe.`\n- **Overall Objects**: Pasta, guanciale (or pancetta), pecorino romano cheese, free-range organic eggs, black pepper, optional garlic, salt, water.\n\t- **Overall Objects Quotes**:`So first up guys, you only need five ingredients.`; `Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, free-range organic egg.`; `Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A classic spaghetti carbonara with a creamy sauce achieved through emulsification, featuring golden guanciale, pecorino cheese, and a perfect balance of flavors.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Look at that guys, look at that. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper.`; `Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino.`; `That my friends, is a thing of joy.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Prepare the ingredients: guanciale, pecorino romano, eggs, pasta, black pepper, and optionally garlic. 2. Boil water with a small amount of salt and twist the pasta into it to prevent sticking. Cook for 8 minutes. 3. Remove the skin from the guanciale and chop it into half-centimeter chunks. 4. Start with a cold pan, add guanciale, and heat to medium-high to render the fat. 5. Crack garlic and add to the pan to infuse flavor. 6. Crush black peppercorns, sieve to separate the hotter inner part, and add to the pan. 7. Crack eggs into a bowl, add pecorino, and whisk. 8. Once guanciale is golden, remove garlic, turn off the heat, and add pasta with some cooking water to the pan. 9. Stir to emulsify the fat and water, then add the egg mixture while tossing. 10. Finish with more black pepper and pecorino before serving.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Grab the pasta by two hands. Twist it into the water.`; `I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale.`; `The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `Crack it. Get a little sieve.`; `I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that.`; `Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan.`; `As we toss, we add some more liquid.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The cold pan allows the fat from the guanciale to render slowly, enhancing flavor. Twisting the pasta prevents it from sticking. Using a small amount of salt in the water balances the saltiness from the cheese and guanciale. Sieving the peppercorns ensures the hotter inner part is used, which is ideal for carbonara. Emulsifying the fat with pasta water creates a creamy sauce without using cream.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `By twisting it, it won't stick together.`; `Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty.`; `This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter.`; `That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for authenticity, but pancetta or bacon can be substituted. Pecorino romano is traditional, but parmesan is commonly used. The technique and timing are crucial for achieving the right texture. Avoid frying the eggs to prevent them from scrambling. Serve immediately for best taste.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles.`; `The cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing.`\n"

Slice thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces.\n2. Heat a pan on medium and add a tiny bit of olive oil.\n3. Add bacon to the pan and render the fat until crispy.\n4. Boil water and add a tablespoon of kosher salt.\n5. Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\n6. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl.\n7. Whisk grated cheese into the egg mixture.\n8. Add fresh ground black pepper to the egg and cheese mixture.\n9. Add a quarter cup of boiling pasta water to the egg mixture to temper it.\n10. Cook spaghetti until slightly al dente.\n11. Turn off the heat and drain most of the bacon fat, leaving about two tablespoons.\n12. Add cooked spaghetti to the pan with bacon fat.\n13. Add egg and cheese mixture to the spaghetti, stirring gently to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n14. If needed, use reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\n15. Plate the pasta and garnish with more cheese and crispy bacon.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`\"Slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\"`; `\"Turn this pan on to medium heat.\"`; `\"Break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy.\"`; `\"Season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.\"`; `\"Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\"`; `\"I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.\"`; `\"Whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.\"`; `\"Put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.\"`; `\"Take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs. Quickly whisk that in.\"`; `\"We'll cook this spaghetti about 10 minutes in this pot, just slightly al dente.\"`; `\"Turn off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so.\"`; `\"Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat.\"`; `\"Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.\"`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy carbonara sauce without scrambling the eggs. Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible. The combination of cheeses adds depth of flavor. Tempering the egg mixture with hot pasta water prevents the eggs from scrambling when mixed with the hot pasta. The rendered bacon fat adds flavor and helps emulsify the sauce.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`\"Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale... but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.\"`; `\"Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.\"`; `\"Carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.\"`; `\"We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end.\"`; `\"The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs.\"`\n- **Overall Tips**: - Use thick-cut bacon or pancetta for best results.\n- Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano are preferred cheeses.\n- Avoid adding olive oil to the pasta water; it's unnecessary.\n- Use pasta water to adjust sauce consistency if needed.\n- Be gentle when mixing the egg mixture with the pasta to avoid scrambling.\n- If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of pasta water to loosen it.\n- Use a pan that retains heat well to help cook the egg mixture gently.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`\"Thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.\"`; `\"Make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.\"`; `\"We're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it.\"`; `\"If it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.\"`\n"

Boil water and add salt at a ratio of 10 grams per liter. Add spaghettoni to the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Do not add oil.\n2. Cut guanciale into chunks and cook it in a pan with olive oil until it releases fat.\n3. Beat two egg yolks in a bowl and add grated parmesan or pecorino cheese and abundant pepper.\n4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with guanciale, allowing it to cool slightly.\n5. Mix the pasta with the egg mixture, ensuring the pasta is not too hot to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n6. Serve with additional parmesan or pecorino and a touch of pepper for decoration.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt.`; `And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta.`; `While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please.`; `Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek.`; `And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan.`; `Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce.`; `And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.`; `To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it.`; `So we put a little bit of parmesan.`; `Abundant pepper.`; `So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that.`; `And now we stir it like this.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The salt in the water seasons the pasta as it cooks. Guanciale is used for its tender and flavorful qualities, which are essential for authentic Carbonara. The eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce without the need for cream, which is traditionally not used. Cooling the pasta slightly before adding the egg mixture prevents the eggs from scrambling, ensuring a creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why.`; `No oil, because you don't need it.`; `And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for the best flavor, but pancetta can be a substitute. Avoid adding cream to maintain authenticity. If the guanciale releases too much fat, you can absorb some with a paper towel. Ensure the pasta is not too hot when mixing with the egg to prevent scrambling. Add cheese and pepper as a final touch for flavor and presentation.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n"

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: To make traditional spaghetti carbonara using accessible ingredients.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`Today, hang out for a second, and you're gonna learn how to do it right.`; `we're gonna use bacon.And thickcut bacon would be best.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.`; `we do not want to scramble these eggs.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`\n- **Overall Objects**: Bacon (or pancetta), spaghetti, Pecorino Romano cheese, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, eggs, kosher salt, black pepper, olive oil (optional), pasta water.\n\t- **Overall Objects Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `we're gonna use bacon.And thickcut bacon would be best.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `we need to talk about the cheese.Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged.`; `I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.`; `I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper.`; `I'm doing a tiny bit of olive oil, I don't think it's traditional, but when I'm cooking Italian food, it just feels right.`; `Another thing I want to share with you, there are tons of expensive pasta brands out in the world, but honestly, like, I like these cheap Italian brands, like this one, Giacchecco.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A creamy, velvety spaghetti carbonara with crispy bacon, coated in a rich egg and cheese sauce, without scrambling the eggs.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.You see how creamy this is?`; `That's going to loosen it up.And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.`; `Done.No scramble, nothing.`; `Just get it off the tongs like so.Oh, man.Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.All over, nothing wrong with that.And of course, some of your crispy bacon.Just for an added crunch.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Slice thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces.\n2. Heat a pan on medium and add a tiny bit of olive oil.\n3. Add bacon to the pan and render the fat until crispy.\n4. Boil water and add a tablespoon of kosher salt.\n5. Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\n6. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl.\n7. Whisk grated cheese into the egg mixture.\n8. Add fresh ground black pepper to the egg and cheese mixture.\n9. Add a quarter cup of boiling pasta water to the egg mixture to temper it.\n10. Cook spaghetti until slightly al dente.\n11. Turn off the heat and drain most of the bacon fat, leaving about two tablespoons.\n12. Add cooked spaghetti to the pan with bacon fat.\n13. Add egg and cheese mixture to the spaghetti, stirring gently to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n14. If needed, use reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\n15. Plate the pasta and garnish with more cheese and crispy bacon.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`\"Slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\"`; `\"Turn this pan on to medium heat.\"`; `\"Break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy.\"`; `\"Season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.\"`; `\"Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\"`; `\"I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.\"`; `\"Whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.\"`; `\"Put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.\"`; `\"Take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs. Quickly whisk that in.\"`; `\"We'll cook this spaghetti about 10 minutes in this pot, just slightly al dente.\"`; `\"Turn off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so.\"`; `\"Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat.\"`; `\"Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.\"`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy carbonara sauce without scrambling the eggs. Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible. The combination of cheeses adds depth of flavor. Tempering the egg mixture with hot pasta water prevents the eggs from scrambling when mixed with the hot pasta. The rendered bacon fat adds flavor and helps emulsify the sauce.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`\"Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale... but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.\"`; `\"Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.\"`; `\"Carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.\"`; `\"We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end.\"`; `\"The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs.\"`\n- **Overall Tips**: - Use thick-cut bacon or pancetta for best results.\n- Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano are preferred cheeses.\n- Avoid adding olive oil to the pasta water; it's unnecessary.\n- Use pasta water to adjust sauce consistency if needed.\n- Be gentle when mixing the egg mixture with the pasta to avoid scrambling.\n- If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of pasta water to loosen it.\n- Use a pan that retains heat well to help cook the egg mixture gently.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`\"Thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.\"`; `\"Make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.\"`; `\"We're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it.\"`; `\"If it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.\"`\n"

Chop bacon into small pieces. 2. Separate egg yolks from whites and set aside the yolks. 3. Grate pecorino romano cheese and mix it with the egg yolks. 4. Add pepper to the egg and cheese mixture. 5. Cook spaghetti in salted boiling water. 6. Cook bacon in a pan until crispy, then turn off the heat and let it cool slightly. 7. Add a bit of pasta water to the egg and cheese mixture. 8. Transfer cooked spaghetti directly from the pot to the bacon pan. 9. Mix the spaghetti with the bacon and then add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring to combine. 10. Add more pasta water if needed to achieve a creamy consistency. 11. Finish with additional pepper and grated cheese before serving.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.`; `We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick.`; `So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling.`; `Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go.`; `Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti.`; `Now our bacon is cooked. We're turning the burner off, waiting for this to cool.`; `Now I'm gonna put in a bit of pasta water into our sauce ingredients.`; `Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation.`; `Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat.`; `Here I'm trying to do that fancy twist thing, but it's not the right tool.`; `We'll finish with some pepper pepper pepper and some more pecorino or parmesan.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy pasta dish that resembles carbonara. Bacon is used instead of guanciale for flavor. Egg yolks and cheese create a rich sauce that is thickened by the heat of the pasta. Pasta water is added to help emulsify the sauce and achieve the desired creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink.`\n- **Overall Tips**: 1. Use guanciale instead of bacon for authentic carbonara. 2. Be careful not to overcook the egg-based sauce by letting the pan cool slightly before adding the egg mixture. 3. Reserve pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency. 4. Avoid breaking spaghetti to maintain its texture. 5. Finish with extra cheese and pepper for added flavor.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`If you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish.`; `If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw.`; `Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months.`; `If you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water.`\n"

This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, free-range organic egg.`; `Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A classic spaghetti carbonara with a creamy sauce achieved through emulsification, featuring golden guanciale, pecorino cheese, and a perfect balance of flavors.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Look at that guys, look at that. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper.`; `Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino.`; `That my friends, is a thing of joy.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Prepare the ingredients: guanciale, pecorino romano, eggs, pasta, black pepper, and optionally garlic. 2. Boil water with a small amount of salt and twist the pasta into it to prevent sticking. Cook for 8 minutes. 3. Remove the skin from the guanciale and chop it into half-centimeter chunks. 4. Start with a cold pan, add guanciale, and heat to medium-high to render the fat. 5. Crack garlic and add to the pan to infuse flavor. 6. Crush black peppercorns, sieve to separate the hotter inner part, and add to the pan. 7. Crack eggs into a bowl, add pecorino, and whisk. 8. Once guanciale is golden, remove garlic, turn off the heat, and add pasta with some cooking water to the pan. 9. Stir to emulsify the fat and water, then add the egg mixture while tossing. 10. Finish with more black pepper and pecorino before serving.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Grab the pasta by two hands. Twist it into the water.`; `I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale.`; `The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `Crack it. Get a little sieve.`; `I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that.`; `Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan.`; `As we toss, we add some more liquid.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The cold pan allows the fat from the guanciale to render slowly, enhancing flavor. Twisting the pasta prevents it from sticking. Using a small amount of salt in the water balances the saltiness from the cheese and guanciale. Sieving the peppercorns ensures the hotter inner part is used, which is ideal for carbonara. Emulsifying the fat with pasta water creates a creamy sauce without using cream.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `By twisting it, it won't stick together.`; `Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty.`; `This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter.`; `That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for authenticity, but pancetta or bacon can be substituted. Pecorino romano is traditional, but parmesan is commonly used. The technique and timing are crucial for achieving the right texture. Avoid frying the eggs to prevent them from scrambling. Serve immediately for best taste.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles.`; `The cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing.`\n"

Slice thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces.\n2. Heat a pan on medium and add a tiny bit of olive oil.\n3. Add bacon to the pan and render the fat until crispy.\n4. Boil water and add a tablespoon of kosher salt.\n5. Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\n6. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl.\n7. Whisk grated cheese into the egg mixture.\n8. Add fresh ground black pepper to the egg and cheese mixture.\n9. Add a quarter cup of boiling pasta water to the egg mixture to temper it.\n10. Cook spaghetti until slightly al dente.\n11. Turn off the heat and drain most of the bacon fat, leaving about two tablespoons.\n12. Add cooked spaghetti to the pan with bacon fat.\n13. Add egg and cheese mixture to the spaghetti, stirring gently to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n14. If needed, use reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\n15. Plate the pasta and garnish with more cheese and crispy bacon.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`\"Slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\"`; `\"Turn this pan on to medium heat.\"`; `\"Break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy.\"`; `\"Season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.\"`; `\"Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\"`; `\"I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.\"`; `\"Whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.\"`; `\"Put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.\"`; `\"Take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs. Quickly whisk that in.\"`; `\"We'll cook this spaghetti about 10 minutes in this pot, just slightly al dente.\"`; `\"Turn off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so.\"`; `\"Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat.\"`; `\"Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.\"`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy carbonara sauce without scrambling the eggs. Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible. The combination of cheeses adds depth of flavor. Tempering the egg mixture with hot pasta water prevents the eggs from scrambling when mixed with the hot pasta. The rendered bacon fat adds flavor and helps emulsify the sauce.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`\"Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale... but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.\"`; `\"Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.\"`; `\"Carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.\"`; `\"We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end.\"`; `\"The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs.\"`\n- **Overall Tips**: - Use thick-cut bacon or pancetta for best results.\n- Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano are preferred cheeses.\n- Avoid adding olive oil to the pasta water; it's unnecessary.\n- Use pasta water to adjust sauce consistency if needed.\n- Be gentle when mixing the egg mixture with the pasta to avoid scrambling.\n- If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of pasta water to loosen it.\n- Use a pan that retains heat well to help cook the egg mixture gently.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`\"Thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.\"`; `\"Make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.\"`; `\"We're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it.\"`; `\"If it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.\"`\n"

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: To make an authentic spaghetti carbonara using traditional ingredients and techniques.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish.`; `I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe.`\n- **Overall Objects**: Pasta, guanciale (or pancetta), pecorino romano cheese, free-range organic eggs, black pepper, optional garlic, salt, water.\n\t- **Overall Objects Quotes**:`So first up guys, you only need five ingredients.`; `Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, free-range organic egg.`; `Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A classic spaghetti carbonara with a creamy sauce achieved through emulsification, featuring golden guanciale, pecorino cheese, and a perfect balance of flavors.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Look at that guys, look at that. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper.`; `Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino.`; `That my friends, is a thing of joy.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Prepare the ingredients: guanciale, pecorino romano, eggs, pasta, black pepper, and optionally garlic. 2. Boil water with a small amount of salt and twist the pasta into it to prevent sticking. Cook for 8 minutes. 3. Remove the skin from the guanciale and chop it into half-centimeter chunks. 4. Start with a cold pan, add guanciale, and heat to medium-high to render the fat. 5. Crack garlic and add to the pan to infuse flavor. 6. Crush black peppercorns, sieve to separate the hotter inner part, and add to the pan. 7. Crack eggs into a bowl, add pecorino, and whisk. 8. Once guanciale is golden, remove garlic, turn off the heat, and add pasta with some cooking water to the pan. 9. Stir to emulsify the fat and water, then add the egg mixture while tossing. 10. Finish with more black pepper and pecorino before serving.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Grab the pasta by two hands. Twist it into the water.`; `I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale.`; `The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `Crack it. Get a little sieve.`; `I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that.`; `Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan.`; `As we toss, we add some more liquid.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The cold pan allows the fat from the guanciale to render slowly, enhancing flavor. Twisting the pasta prevents it from sticking. Using a small amount of salt in the water balances the saltiness from the cheese and guanciale. Sieving the peppercorns ensures the hotter inner part is used, which is ideal for carbonara. Emulsifying the fat with pasta water creates a creamy sauce without using cream.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `By twisting it, it won't stick together.`; `Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty.`; `This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter.`; `That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for authenticity, but pancetta or bacon can be substituted. Pecorino romano is traditional, but parmesan is commonly used. The technique and timing are crucial for achieving the right texture. Avoid frying the eggs to prevent them from scrambling. Serve immediately for best taste.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles.`; `The cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing.`\n"

Boil water and add salt at a ratio of 10 grams per liter. Add spaghettoni to the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Do not add oil.\n2. Cut guanciale into chunks and cook it in a pan with olive oil until it releases fat.\n3. Beat two egg yolks in a bowl and add grated parmesan or pecorino cheese and abundant pepper.\n4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with guanciale, allowing it to cool slightly.\n5. Mix the pasta with the egg mixture, ensuring the pasta is not too hot to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n6. Serve with additional parmesan or pecorino and a touch of pepper for decoration.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt.`; `And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta.`; `While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please.`; `Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek.`; `And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan.`; `Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce.`; `And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.`; `To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it.`; `So we put a little bit of parmesan.`; `Abundant pepper.`; `So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that.`; `And now we stir it like this.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The salt in the water seasons the pasta as it cooks. Guanciale is used for its tender and flavorful qualities, which are essential for authentic Carbonara. The eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce without the need for cream, which is traditionally not used. Cooling the pasta slightly before adding the egg mixture prevents the eggs from scrambling, ensuring a creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why.`; `No oil, because you don't need it.`; `And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for the best flavor, but pancetta can be a substitute. Avoid adding cream to maintain authenticity. If the guanciale releases too much fat, you can absorb some with a paper towel. Ensure the pasta is not too hot when mixing with the egg to prevent scrambling. Add cheese and pepper as a final touch for flavor and presentation.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n"

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: To make a dish that resembles Pasta Carbonara but is explicitly not traditional Carbonara.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`Today we're not making spaghetti carbonara.`; `Some might say it looks like carbonara, and tastes like carbonara, and has the mouthfeel of carbonara, the substances which make up carbonara, and even the personality of carbonara.`; `But this is not carbonara.`\n- **Overall Objects**: Bacon, egg yolks, pecorino romano cheese, spaghetti, pasta water, pepper.\n\t- **Overall Objects Quotes**:`The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not.`; `Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti.`; `Now I'm gonna put in a bit of pasta water into our sauce ingredients to get that cheeseahead start on the melting.`; `Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat.`; `We'll finish with some pepper pepper pepper and some more pecorino or parmesan.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A pasta dish that resembles Carbonara in appearance and taste but is intentionally not traditional Carbonara, as it uses bacon instead of guanciale and other non-traditional methods.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`And here we don't have carbonara.`; `If this was carbonara, you'd have to be careful, because the carbonistic properties are so fragile that if you put in a single pea, it would no longer be carbonara.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Chop bacon into small pieces. 2. Separate egg yolks from whites and set aside the yolks. 3. Grate pecorino romano cheese and mix it with the egg yolks. 4. Add pepper to the egg and cheese mixture. 5. Cook spaghetti in salted boiling water. 6. Cook bacon in a pan until crispy, then turn off the heat and let it cool slightly. 7. Add a bit of pasta water to the egg and cheese mixture. 8. Transfer cooked spaghetti directly from the pot to the bacon pan. 9. Mix the spaghetti with the bacon and then add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring to combine. 10. Add more pasta water if needed to achieve a creamy consistency. 11. Finish with additional pepper and grated cheese before serving.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.`; `We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick.`; `So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling.`; `Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go.`; `Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti.`; `Now our bacon is cooked. We're turning the burner off, waiting for this to cool.`; `Now I'm gonna put in a bit of pasta water into our sauce ingredients.`; `Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation.`; `Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat.`; `Here I'm trying to do that fancy twist thing, but it's not the right tool.`; `We'll finish with some pepper pepper pepper and some more pecorino or parmesan.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy pasta dish that resembles carbonara. Bacon is used instead of guanciale for flavor. Egg yolks and cheese create a rich sauce that is thickened by the heat of the pasta. Pasta water is added to help emulsify the sauce and achieve the desired creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink.`\n- **Overall Tips**: 1. Use guanciale instead of bacon for authentic carbonara. 2. Be careful not to overcook the egg-based sauce by letting the pan cool slightly before adding the egg mixture. 3. Reserve pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency. 4. Avoid breaking spaghetti to maintain its texture. 5. Finish with extra cheese and pepper for added flavor.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`If you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.`; `Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish.`; `If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw.`; `Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months.`; `If you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water.`\n"

Boil water and add salt at a ratio of 10 grams per liter. Add spaghettoni to the boiling water and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Do not add oil.\n2. Cut guanciale into chunks and cook it in a pan with olive oil until it releases fat.\n3. Beat two egg yolks in a bowl and add grated parmesan or pecorino cheese and abundant pepper.\n4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with guanciale, allowing it to cool slightly.\n5. Mix the pasta with the egg mixture, ensuring the pasta is not too hot to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n6. Serve with additional parmesan or pecorino and a touch of pepper for decoration.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt.`; `And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta.`; `While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please.`; `Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek.`; `And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan.`; `Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce.`; `And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.`; `To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it.`; `So we put a little bit of parmesan.`; `Abundant pepper.`; `So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that.`; `And now we stir it like this.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The salt in the water seasons the pasta as it cooks. Guanciale is used for its tender and flavorful qualities, which are essential for authentic Carbonara. The eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce without the need for cream, which is traditionally not used. Cooling the pasta slightly before adding the egg mixture prevents the eggs from scrambling, ensuring a creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why.`; `No oil, because you don't need it.`; `And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for the best flavor, but pancetta can be a substitute. Avoid adding cream to maintain authenticity. If the guanciale releases too much fat, you can absorb some with a paper towel. Ensure the pasta is not too hot when mixing with the egg to prevent scrambling. Add cheese and pepper as a final touch for flavor and presentation.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n"

Slice thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces.\n2. Heat a pan on medium and add a tiny bit of olive oil.\n3. Add bacon to the pan and render the fat until crispy.\n4. Boil water and add a tablespoon of kosher salt.\n5. Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\n6. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl.\n7. Whisk grated cheese into the egg mixture.\n8. Add fresh ground black pepper to the egg and cheese mixture.\n9. Add a quarter cup of boiling pasta water to the egg mixture to temper it.\n10. Cook spaghetti until slightly al dente.\n11. Turn off the heat and drain most of the bacon fat, leaving about two tablespoons.\n12. Add cooked spaghetti to the pan with bacon fat.\n13. Add egg and cheese mixture to the spaghetti, stirring gently to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n14. If needed, use reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\n15. Plate the pasta and garnish with more cheese and crispy bacon.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`\"Slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch.\"`; `\"Turn this pan on to medium heat.\"`; `\"Break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy.\"`; `\"Season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.\"`; `\"Grate Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses finely.\"`; `\"I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.\"`; `\"Whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.\"`; `\"Put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.\"`; `\"Take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs.

Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.\"`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The steps are designed to create a creamy carbonara sauce without scrambling the eggs. Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible. The combination of cheeses adds depth of flavor. Tempering the egg mixture with hot pasta water prevents the eggs from scrambling when mixed with the hot pasta. The rendered bacon fat adds flavor and helps emulsify the sauce.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`\"Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale... but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.\"`; `\"Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.\"`; `\"Carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.\"`; `\"We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end.\"`; `\"The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs.\"`\n- **Overall Tips**: - Use thick-cut bacon or pancetta for best results.\n- Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano are preferred cheeses.\n- Avoid adding olive oil to the pasta water; it's unnecessary.\n- Use pasta water to adjust sauce consistency if needed.\n- Be gentle when mixing the egg mixture with the pasta to avoid scrambling.\n- If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of pasta water to loosen it.\n- Use a pan that retains heat well to help cook the egg mixture gently.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`\"Thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.\"`; `\"Make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.\"`; `\"We're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth.\"`; `\"If it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.\"`; `\"Gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it.\"`; `\"If it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.\"`\n"

Cut guanciale into chunks and cook it in a pan with olive oil until it releases fat.\n3. Beat two egg yolks in a bowl and add grated parmesan or pecorino cheese and abundant pepper.\n4. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with guanciale, allowing it to cool slightly.\n5. Mix the pasta with the egg mixture, ensuring the pasta is not too hot to avoid scrambling the eggs.\n6. Serve with additional parmesan or pecorino and a touch of pepper for decoration.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt.`; `And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta.`; `While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please.`; `Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek.`; `And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan.`; `Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce.`; `And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.`; `To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it.`; `So we put a little bit of parmesan.`; `Abundant pepper.`; `So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that.`; `And now we stir it like this.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The salt in the water seasons the pasta as it cooks. Guanciale is used for its tender and flavorful qualities, which are essential for authentic Carbonara. The eggs and cheese create a creamy sauce without the need for cream, which is traditionally not used. Cooling the pasta slightly before adding the egg mixture prevents the eggs from scrambling, ensuring a creamy texture.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why.`; `No oil, because you don't need it.`; `And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for the best flavor, but pancetta can be a substitute. Avoid adding cream to maintain authenticity. If the guanciale releases too much fat, you can absorb some with a paper towel. Ensure the pasta is not too hot when mixing with the egg to prevent scrambling. Add cheese and pepper as a final touch for flavor and presentation.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here.`; `To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.Absolutely forbidden.`; `Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick.`; `And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.`; `And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.`\n"

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: To make an authentic spaghetti carbonara using traditional ingredients and techniques.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish.`; `I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe.`\n- **Overall Objects**: Pasta, guanciale (or pancetta), pecorino romano cheese, free-range organic eggs, black pepper, optional garlic, salt, water.\n\t- **Overall Objects Quotes**:`So first up guys, you only need five ingredients.`; `Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, free-range organic egg.`; `Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: A classic spaghetti carbonara with a creamy sauce achieved through emulsification, featuring golden guanciale, pecorino cheese, and a perfect balance of flavors.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Look at that guys, look at that. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper.`; `Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino.`; `That my friends, is a thing of joy.`\n- **Overall Instructions**: 1. Prepare the ingredients: guanciale, pecorino romano, eggs, pasta, black pepper, and optionally garlic. 2. Boil water with a small amount of salt and twist the pasta into it to prevent sticking. Cook for 8 minutes. 3. Remove the skin from the guanciale and chop it into half-centimeter chunks. 4. Start with a cold pan, add guanciale, and heat to medium-high to render the fat. 5. Crack garlic and add to the pan to infuse flavor. 6. Crush black peppercorns, sieve to separate the hotter inner part, and add to the pan. 7. Crack eggs into a bowl, add pecorino, and whisk. 8. Once guanciale is golden, remove garlic, turn off the heat, and add pasta with some cooking water to the pan. 9. Stir to emulsify the fat and water, then add the egg mixture while tossing. 10. Finish with more black pepper and pecorino before serving.\n\t- **Overall Instructions Quotes**:`Grab the pasta by two hands. Twist it into the water.`; `I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale.`; `The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `Crack it. Get a little sieve.`; `I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that.`; `Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan.`; `As we toss, we add some more liquid.`\n- **Overall Rationale**: The cold pan allows the fat from the guanciale to render slowly, enhancing flavor. Twisting the pasta prevents it from sticking. Using a small amount of salt in the water balances the saltiness from the cheese and guanciale. Sieving the peppercorns ensures the hotter inner part is used, which is ideal for carbonara. Emulsifying the fat with pasta water creates a creamy sauce without using cream.\n\t- **Overall Rationale Quotes**:`The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `By twisting it, it won't stick together.`; `Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty.`; `This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter.`; `That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.`\n- **Overall Tips**: Use guanciale for authenticity, but pancetta or bacon can be substituted. Pecorino romano is traditional, but parmesan is commonly used. The technique and timing are crucial for achieving the right texture. Avoid frying the eggs to prevent them from scrambling. Serve immediately for best taste.\n\t- **Overall Tips Quotes**:`Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork.`; `Most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.`; `Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles.`; `The cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing.`\n"

- Fai schifo cucinare, ja totalmente schifo!
	- []

- Today we're not making spaghetti carbonara.
	- ['goal_content_ids']

- Some might say it looks like carbonara, and tastes like carbonara, and has the mouthfeel of carbonara, the substances which make up carbonara, and even the personality of carbonara.
	- ['goal_content_ids']

- But this is not carbonara.
	- ['goal_content_ids', 'outcome_content_ids']

- The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale.
	- ['rationale_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog.
	- []

- Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse!
	- []

- You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you?
	- []

- I really hope not.
	- []

- Tigers are expensive.
	- []

- Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'rationale_content_ids']

- Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth.
	- []

- Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer.
	- []

- Mmm.
	- []

- This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not.
	- ['objects_content_ids']

- It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs.
	- []

- So did the goats.
	- []

- They worked out together.
	- []

- If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- So, whoop.
	- []

- All right.
	- []

- If I just maybe... okay, let's try.
	- []

- Nope.
	- []

- See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue.
	- []

- If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze.
	- []

- So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet.
	- []

- The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region.
	- []

- Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style.
	- []

- Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti.
	- []

- And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.
	- []

- Now let's just fix that.
	- []

- Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- It sounds like an overreaction at first, but the crack sends a shock wave through the noodle, rendering it completely inedible.
	- []

- I mean look, here's uncracked spaghetti and cracked spaghetti.
	- []

- If I didn't tell you that was spaghetti, you wouldn't have even recognized it.
	- []

- Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- Keep wang jangling that for the first bit to keep the spag from getting clingy.
	- []

- By the way, spaghetti gets its name because you put it in the spa to cook it.
	- []

- Now our bacon is cooked.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- We're turning the burner off, waiting for this to cool, at least until there's no sizzle left, and a bit longer so we don't overcook the eggbased sauce.
	- []

- Now I'm gonna put in a bit of pasta water into our sauce ingredients to get that cheeseahead start on the melting.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Since noodles are made of wheat, this is essentially a bacon sandwich, but if you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water, and if you get the kind of spaghetti with dehydrated meatballs, just pull those out and set them aside.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water making this nice and creamy.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- Here I'm trying to do that fancy twist thing, but it's not the right tool, and I don't know what I'm doing.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- We'll finish with some pepper pepper pepper and some more pecorino or parmesan, and here we don't have carbonara.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- If you want to really see not carbonara, here's an earlier attempt where I used whole egg.
	- []

- Too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great.
	- []

- So are the whims of the food gods.
	- []

- If this was carbonara, you'd have to be careful, because the carbonistic properties are so fragile that if you put in a single pea, it would no longer be carbonara.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- It's a mysterious chemical reaction that only Italian scientists understand.
	- []

- I'm craving carbonara, but I don't have guanciale.
	- []

- Should I really even bother?
	- []

- Oh no, will they judge my carbonara?
	- []

- Because I want some cream upon it.
	- []

- Should I eat it in the closet?
	- []

- Oh no, what have I done?
	- []

- I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetable free.
	- []

- They say it's no game.
	- []

- Hang my head as I eat this not carbonara in shame.
	- []


#### dzyXBU3dIys
- You need to understand, carbonara does not need cream, or peas, or ham, or whatever else people are putting in it.
	- []

- It's so simple!
	- []

- Today, hang out for a second, and you're gonna learn how to do it right.
	- ['goal_content_ids']

- Let's not waste any time, now let's go!
	- []

- Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'rationale_content_ids']

- So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.
	- []

- And thickcut bacon would be best.
	- ['goal_content_ids', 'objects_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- You could also use pancetta.
	- []

- So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- That's about three quarters of an inch.
	- []

- Turn this pan on to medium heat.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- I'm doing a tiny bit of olive oil, I don't think it's traditional, but when I'm cooking Italian food, it just feels right.
	- ['objects_content_ids']

- Then go ahead and break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy.
	- ['outcome_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- We'll use most of it in the pasta, and then we'll actually use some for garnish, because who doesn't like crispy bacon on top?
	- []

- Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water.
	- ['goal_content_ids', 'objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- So first is very important, we need to talk about the cheese.
	- []

- Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano.
	- []

- That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding.
	- []

- I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description.
	- []

- Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up.
	- []

- So here's all our beautiful cheese.
	- []

- Okay, now time for the eggs.
	- []

- A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks.
	- []

- I like to do a mixture of both.
	- []

- So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.
	- ['goal_content_ids', 'objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right?
	- []

- But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore.
	- []

- Add that all in.
	- []

- And so now we have a consistency like this.
	- []

- Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert.
	- []

- I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper.
	- []

- He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020.
	- []

- You know, and this is preference.
	- []

- Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.
	- []

- As you can see, there's a lot of fat coming out of this bacon.
	- []

- Just want to turn this occasionally.
	- []

- And we are going to be using some, but not all of this fat in the actual spaghetti carbonara.
	- []

- Another thing you can do is just take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Quickly whisk that in.
	- []

- We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- I put just about a quarter cup in here.
	- []

- Our bacon is almost rendered, so now we'll drop our spaghetti.
	- []

- We'll try to do that twisty thing.
	- []

- Kind of worked.
	- []

- Just get a little bit of water up on it.
	- []

- Let that roll.
	- []

- Check it on the bacon.
	- []

- I turned the heat down in the end.
	- []

- Be careful not to overcook this.
	- []

- Looks pretty much perfect.
	- []

- First, I'm going to take some out for garnish.
	- []

- Drain it on a paper towel.
	- []

- Now I'm turning off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- And then just set that back over there.
	- []

- Remember, now, heat is off.
	- []

- This is so important.
	- []

- Okay, and of course, we're going to put some olive oil in this pasta.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- No, we're not going to do that.
	- []

- Why do people do that?
	- []

- It's a myth.
	- []

- It's a myth.
	- []

- Just like MSG is going to give you cancer or whatever.
	- []

- It's just not true, and it serves no purpose.
	- []

- So don't do it.
	- []

- Don't do it, okay?
	- []

- Another thing I want to share with you, there are tons of expensive pasta brands out in the world, but honestly, like, I like these cheap Italian brands, like this one, Giacchecco.
	- ['objects_content_ids']

- I don't know how to say it, but like, I don't know why.
	- []

- I just prefer the cheap one.
	- []

- So if anyone's wondering, this is what I use.
	- []

- So we'll cook this spaghetti about 10 minutes in this pot, just slightly al dente, and then we'll finish it over in this baking pan.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Remember, still no heat on this pan.
	- []

- I'm going to explain all this soon, but you want to leave this water in this pot.
	- []

- This will make sense in a minute.
	- []

- So here we go.
	- []

- It's been 10 minutes.
	- []

- We're just going to use our tongs here.
	- []

- Drop that in there.
	- []

- Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Turn that pasta water down to a simmer.
	- []

- Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs.
	- ['goal_content_ids', 'rationale_content_ids']

- The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?
	- ['goal_content_ids', 'outcome_content_ids']

- And don't worry, you're not eating raw eggs.
	- []

- And gentle with the pasta.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- You don't want to break it.
	- []

- Oh, man.
	- []

- And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- You see how creamy this is?
	- []

- I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat.
	- []

- So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on.
	- []

- Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- But I don't think I even really need to do this.
	- []

- But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this.
	- []

- Oh, my God.
	- []

- Looks so good.
	- []

- And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.
	- ['instructions_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- That's going to loosen it up.
	- []

- And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- Done.
	- []

- No scramble, nothing.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- Go ahead and plate this up.
	- []

- Just get it off the tongs like so.
	- []

- Oh, man.
	- []

- Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- All over, nothing wrong with that.
	- []

- And of course, some of your crispy bacon.
	- []

- Just for an added crunch.
	- []

- That is a bonus no one is going to complain about.
	- []

- Trust me. I mean, how bad do you want to tuck into this treat?
	- []

- Allow me to try it.
	- []

- Oh, allow me to try it for you.
	- []

- Here we go.
	- []

- A little bacon.
	- []

- Oh, gosh.
	- []

- I see a lot of people who leave my YouTube videos right now.
	- []

- It's such a big mistake.
	- []

- They obviously don't know about the fridge.
	- []

- Oh, God, that's good.
	- []

- You've got to make this.
	- []

- Here's my rolling pin.
	- []

- I just feel like this is what an Italian grandmother would do.
	- []

- Whew.
	- []

- What?
	- []

- Well, I hope that helped.
	- []

- Until next time, my friends, you know I love you when I'm out.
	- []

- Pasta, cream, bacon.
	- []

- Cream?
	- []

- Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish.
	- ['goal_content_ids']

- Pasta, cheese, bacon.
	- []

- What's not to love, right?
	- []

- But it's really controversial.
	- []

- I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe.
	- ['goal_content_ids']

- So first up guys, you only need five ingredients.
	- ['objects_content_ids']

- Guanciale.
	- []

- This is the cured cheek of pork.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- And as you can see, it's all about the fat.
	- []

- It's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried and it's aged.
	- []

- Of course, it's similar to smoked bacon and you can get some pretty good results actually.
	- []

- But you can see this is quite lean.
	- []

- So try and get them to not cut off the fat because you need it.
	- []

- Or there's pancetta.
	- []

- Then, most people use parmesan.
	- []

- But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- Sheep's cheese.
	- []

- It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg.
	- ['objects_content_ids']

- Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.
	- ['objects_content_ids']

- So first up guys, grab the pasta by two hands.
	- []

- Twist it into the water.
	- []

- By twisting it, it won't stick together.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- This beautiful pasta takes eight minutes to cook.
	- []

- So I've got my guanciale.
	- []

- I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Roughly chop this to about half centimetre chunks.
	- []

- Now, the pan is cold.
	- []

- Turn it on to a mediumhigh heat.
	- []

- The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.
	- ['instructions_content_ids', 'rationale_content_ids']

- The guanciale goes in to the pan and this pan is getting hot.
	- []

- Give the garlic a crack and then put it in the pan.
	- []

- As this starts to sizzle, the fat will just pull out some of that perfume from the garlic.
	- []

- Then there's the black pepper.
	- []

- Get your peppercorns in a pestle and mortar.
	- []

- Crack it.
	- []

- Get a little sieve.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- This is one of the most important little bits and no one really does it, okay.
	- []

- Honestly, this is the outer skin.
	- []

- This is much milder.
	- []

- What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- Perfect for a good hot carbonara.
	- []

- The guanciale is getting golden.
	- []

- Now, let's get on to the eggs.
	- []

- Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles and we don't want that.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- I'm gonna take a bowl and I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- So, like 20 grams.
	- []

- Now, we're time sensitive so we're gonna have a little whisk up.
	- []

- We've got dark guanciale.
	- []

- We've got the fat that's come out of it and that's what you want.
	- []

- You want attitude and colour.
	- []

- Now, I'm gonna remove that garlic.
	- []

- Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Use the water to stop the frying.
	- []

- Bit of water, bit of water.
	- []

- That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- We're not frying anymore.
	- []

- Can you hear that?
	- []

- Quiet.
	- []

- No frying at all.
	- []

- Only then can we think about adding our egg.
	- []

- As we toss, we add some more liquid.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- That's the cream.
	- []

- You get the cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- So, as simple as this is, it's technical.
	- []

- Get your friends, your family, get them around the table.
	- []

- Glass of wine.
	- []

- Look at that guys, look at that.
	- []

- Carbonara and you finish with more pepper.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- I'm so excited.
	- []

- Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- That is as classic as I can give you guys, from chefs, from nonnas.
	- []

- It's about quality ingredients, the guanciale, the pecorino romana, quality eggs, the pepper, the technique of the pepper, good pasta and then the sensitivity of cooking it right.
	- []

- Come on.
	- []

- There's a little platter for two people and of course, the most important thing when you eat pasta is don't watch it, eat it.
	- []

- Mmm.
	- []

- That my friends, is a thing of joy.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']


#### 3AAdKl1UYZs
- I am Antonio Carluccio.
	- []

- Welcome to my kitchen.
	- []

- I show you how to make the real Carbonara.
	- ['goal_content_ids']

- Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why.
	- ['goal_content_ids', 'rationale_content_ids']

- Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- Has to be like this.
	- []

- And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- In this case, it's sort of spaghettoni, the biggest size of spaghetti.
	- []

- While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- No oil, because you don't need it.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- You just need to stir a little bit when it's in it, and that's it.
	- []

- Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- Now, you have to cut it in chunks.
	- []

- You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- But I like the guanciale when I have it, obviously.
	- []

- And this is the recipe for two people.
	- []

- Big chunks.
	- []

- The Romans, they are mad for this pasta.
	- []

- If there is a Roman pasta, it is this one here.
	- []

- This is quite a lot for two people, let's see.
	- []

- And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- There you are.
	- []

- Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce, and mostly also the end of it.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- Because the rest is coming here into that bowl.
	- []

- And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- Oh, lovely colour, look at this.
	- []

- To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.
	- ['rationale_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- Absolutely forbidden.
	- []

- So this is the beginning of the sauce.
	- []

- So we put a little bit of parmesan.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- In Roma, they use also pecorino cheese, which is a cheese to be grated.
	- ['objects_content_ids']

- There are fresh pecorino and aged pecorino.
	- []

- But it's lovely to have a little bit of this.
	- []

- Abundant pepper.
	- ['objects_content_ids', 'instructions_content_ids']

- And another stir.
	- []

- And this is the sauce.
	- []

- I wouldn't put any salt here because the bacon here is quite salty, it's preserved.
	- []

- We reduce it a little bit because I'm going to see what the pasta does.
	- []

- I can see it is still stiff.
	- []

- So I put it back again another three or four minutes.
	- []

- Now here's the bacon that has produced also quite a lot of fat.
	- []

- Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick.
	- ['tips_content_ids']

- Here we are.
	- []

- And do this.
	- []

- You absorb a little bit of the fat, and you take it off like this.
	- []

- Very simple.
	- []

- So the pasta seems to be doing well here, the taste now should be enough.
	- []

- I switched off the guanciale because it's too hot and this is exactly what I don't want to be too hot.
	- []

- So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- And you flavour it like this.
	- []

- You let it cool down in doing this.
	- []

- And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta.
	- ['rationale_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- And now it comes, yes, the resistance, the actual sauce.
	- []

- There you are.
	- []

- And now we stir it like this.
	- ['instructions_content_ids']

- You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.
	- ['rationale_content_ids']

- Not too scrambly.
	- []

- And this is the carbonara.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- And now the last touch, which is the embellishment.
	- []

- Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like.
	- ['instructions_content_ids', 'tips_content_ids']

- And in my opinion also a nice touch of pepper.
	- []

- This is decoration for me.
	- []

- And this is the real carbonara.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- The only one.
	- []

- And it's exactly how it should be.
	- []

- Creamy, without adding cream because this is the usual thing.
	- []

- Like this is just fantastic.
	- ['outcome_content_ids']

- Cameraman, everybody, you should taste it.
	- []

- It's just wonderful.
	- []
