    "content": "Contents:\n```Fai schifo cucinare, ja totalmente schifo! Today we're not making spaghetti carbonara. Some might say it looks like carbonara, and tastes like carbonara, and has the mouthfeel of carbonara, the substances which make up carbonara, and even the personality of carbonara. But this is not carbonara. The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon. That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares. Now let's just fix that. Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months. It sounds like an overreaction at first, but the crack sends a shock wave through the noodle, rendering it completely inedible. I mean look, here's uncracked spaghetti and cracked spaghetti. If I didn't tell you that was spaghetti, you wouldn't have even recognized it. Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti. Keep wang jangling that for the first bit to keep the spag from getting clingy. By the way, spaghetti gets its name because you put it in the spa to cook it. Now our bacon is cooked. We're turning the burner off, waiting for this to cool, at least until there's no sizzle left, and a bit longer so we don't overcook the eggbased sauce. Now I'm gonna put in a bit of pasta water into our sauce ingredients to get that cheeseahead start on the melting. Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation. Since noodles are made of wheat, this is essentially a bacon sandwich, but if you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water, and if you get the kind of spaghetti with dehydrated meatballs, just pull those out and set them aside. Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water making this nice and creamy. The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink. Here I'm trying to do that fancy twist thing, but it's not the right tool, and I don't know what I'm doing. We'll finish with some pepper pepper pepper and some more pecorino or parmesan, and here we don't have carbonara. If you want to really see not carbonara, here's an earlier attempt where I used whole egg. Too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great. So are the whims of the food gods. If this was carbonara, you'd have to be careful, because the carbonistic properties are so fragile that if you put in a single pea, it would no longer be carbonara. It's a mysterious chemical reaction that only Italian scientists understand. I'm craving carbonara, but I don't have guanciale. Should I really even bother? Oh no, will they judge my carbonara? Because I want some cream upon it. Should I eat it in the closet? Oh no, what have I done? I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetable free. They say it's no game. Hang my head as I eat this not carbonara in shame.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```You need to understand, carbonara does not need cream, or peas, or ham, or whatever else people are putting in it. It's so simple! Today, hang out for a second, and you're gonna learn how to do it right. Let's not waste any time, now let's go! Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured. So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon. And thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta. So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch. Turn this pan on to medium heat. I'm doing a tiny bit of olive oil, I don't think it's traditional, but when I'm cooking Italian food, it just feels right. Then go ahead and break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy. We'll use most of it in the pasta, and then we'll actually use some for garnish, because who doesn't like crispy bacon on top? Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water. Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water. So first is very important, we need to talk about the cheese. Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged. I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in. As you can see, there's a lot of fat coming out of this bacon. Just want to turn this occasionally. And we are going to be using some, but not all of this fat in the actual spaghetti carbonara. Another thing you can do is just take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs. Quickly whisk that in. We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end. I put just about a quarter cup in here. Our bacon is almost rendered, so now we'll drop our spaghetti. We'll try to do that twisty thing. Kind of worked. Just get a little bit of water up on it. Let that roll. Check it on the bacon. I turned the heat down in the end. Be careful not to overcook this. Looks pretty much perfect. First, I'm going to take some out for garnish. Drain it on a paper towel. Now I'm turning off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so. And then just set that back over there. Remember, now, heat is off. This is so important. Okay, and of course, we're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth. It's a myth. Just like MSG is going to give you cancer or whatever. It's just not true, and it serves no purpose. So don't do it. Don't do it, okay? Another thing I want to share with you, there are tons of expensive pasta brands out in the world, but honestly, like, I like these cheap Italian brands, like this one, Giacchecco. I don't know how to say it, but like, I don't know why. I just prefer the cheap one. So if anyone's wondering, this is what I use. So we'll cook this spaghetti about 10 minutes in this pot, just slightly al dente, and then we'll finish it over in this baking pan. Remember, still no heat on this pan. I'm going to explain all this soon, but you want to leave this water in this pot. This will make sense in a minute. So here we go. It's been 10 minutes. We're just going to use our tongs here. Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat. Turn that pasta water down to a simmer. Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture. The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs. The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right? And don't worry, you're not eating raw eggs. And gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it. Oh, man. And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta. You see how creamy this is? I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat. So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture. But I don't think I even really need to do this. But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this. Oh, my God. Looks so good. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water. That's going to loosen it up. And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream. Done. No scramble, nothing. Go ahead and plate this up. Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano. All over, nothing wrong with that. And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch. That is a bonus no one is going to complain about. Trust me. I mean, how bad do you want to tuck into this treat? Allow me to try it. Oh, allow me to try it for you. Here we go. A little bacon. Oh, gosh. I see a lot of people who leave my YouTube videos right now. It's such a big mistake. They obviously don't know about the fridge. Oh, God, that's good. You've got to make this. Here's my rolling pin. I just feel like this is what an Italian grandmother would do. Whew. What? Well, I hope that helped. Until next time, my friends, you know I love you when I'm out.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Pasta, cream, bacon. Cream? Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish. Pasta, cheese, bacon. What's not to love, right? But it's really controversial. I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe. So first up guys, you only need five ingredients. Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork. And as you can see, it's all about the fat. It's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried and it's aged. Of course, it's similar to smoked bacon and you can get some pretty good results actually. But you can see this is quite lean. So try and get them to not cut off the fat because you need it. Or there's pancetta. Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano. Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg. Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic. So first up guys, grab the pasta by two hands. Twist it into the water. By twisting it, it won't stick together. Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty. This beautiful pasta takes eight minutes to cook. So I've got my guanciale. I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale. Roughly chop this to about half centimetre chunks. Now, the pan is cold. Turn it on to a mediumhigh heat. The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out. The guanciale goes in to the pan and this pan is getting hot. Give the garlic a crack and then put it in the pan. As this starts to sizzle, the fat will just pull out some of that perfume from the garlic. Then there's the black pepper. Get your peppercorns in a pestle and mortar. Crack it. Get a little sieve. This is one of the most important little bits and no one really does it, okay. Honestly, this is the outer skin. This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter. Perfect for a good hot carbonara. The guanciale is getting golden. Now, let's get on to the eggs. Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles and we don't want that. I'm gonna take a bowl and I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that. So, like 20 grams. Now, we're time sensitive so we're gonna have a little whisk up. We've got dark guanciale. We've got the fat that's come out of it and that's what you want. You want attitude and colour. Now, I'm gonna remove that garlic. Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan. Use the water to stop the frying. Bit of water, bit of water. That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce. We're not frying anymore. Can you hear that? Quiet. No frying at all. Only then can we think about adding our egg. As we toss, we add some more liquid. That's the cream. You get the cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing. So, as simple as this is, it's technical. Get your friends, your family, get them around the table. Glass of wine. Look at that guys, look at that. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper. I'm so excited. Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino. That is as classic as I can give you guys, from chefs, from nonnas. It's about quality ingredients, the guanciale, the pecorino romana, quality eggs, the pepper, the technique of the pepper, good pasta and then the sensitivity of cooking it right. Come on. There's a little platter for two people and of course, the most important thing when you eat pasta is don't watch it, eat it. Mmm. That my friends, is a thing of joy.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```I am Antonio Carluccio. Welcome to my kitchen. I show you how to make the real Carbonara. Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why. Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt. Has to be like this. And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta. In this case, it's sort of spaghettoni, the biggest size of spaghetti. While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please. No oil, because you don't need it. You just need to stir a little bit when it's in it, and that's it. Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek. And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender. Now, you have to cut it in chunks. You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here. But I like the guanciale when I have it, obviously. And this is the recipe for two people. Big chunks. The Romans, they are mad for this pasta. If there is a Roman pasta, it is this one here. This is quite a lot for two people, let's see. And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan. There you are. Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce, and mostly also the end of it. Because the rest is coming here into that bowl. And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs. Oh, lovely colour, look at this. To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it. To this, you don't add any, any, any cream. Absolutely forbidden. So this is the beginning of the sauce. So we put a little bit of parmesan. In Roma, they use also pecorino cheese, which is a cheese to be grated. There are fresh pecorino and aged pecorino. But it's lovely to have a little bit of this. Abundant pepper. And another stir. And this is the sauce. I wouldn't put any salt here because the bacon here is quite salty, it's preserved. We reduce it a little bit because I'm going to see what the pasta does. I can see it is still stiff. So I put it back again another three or four minutes. Now here's the bacon that has produced also quite a lot of fat. Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick. Here we are. And do this. You absorb a little bit of the fat, and you take it off like this. Very simple. So the pasta seems to be doing well here, the taste now should be enough. I switched off the guanciale because it's too hot and this is exactly what I don't want to be too hot. So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that. And you flavour it like this. You let it cool down in doing this. And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta. And now it comes, yes, the resistance, the actual sauce. There you are. And now we stir it like this. You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs. Not too scrambly. And this is the carbonara. And now the last touch, which is the embellishment. Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like. And in my opinion also a nice touch of pepper. This is decoration for me. And this is the real carbonara. The only one. And it's exactly how it should be. Creamy, without adding cream because this is the usual thing. Like this is just fantastic. Cameraman, everybody, you should taste it. It's just wonderful.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hey folks, about a year ago, a group of realdeal Italian chefs savagely critiqued some of the biggest Carbonara videos on the Internet, and as you may remember, my entry was not very well received. Since then, I've dreamt of nothing but redemption, so today we're going to take a crack at two different versions of Carbonara, a realdeal, oldschool Italian version, and a more modern, less traditional version that's sure to piss them off. Let's get down to basics. Carbonara Alright, so before we can make Carbonara, we've got to make Carbonara, which, by definition, is made with guanciale, a type of cured pork jowl. It is very delicious, but a little hard to find, so if you can't find it, you can sub with pancetta if you're in a pinch. I've got maybe a half pound here that I'm gonna cut into relatively sizable chunks, and then set aside to make one of the essential elements of any Carbonara dish, the egg slurry. Into a medium bowl or measuring cup goes three large eggs and one egg yolk for a little added richness. And then it's time to finely grate and measure out four ounces of cheese. Truly traditional Carbonara uses 100 Pecorino Romano cheese, but is commonly balanced out with ParmigianoReggiano. If you want it a little less sharp and a little more nutty, I'm going for a 5050 ratio, into which I'm going to dump our beaten eggs. We're then going to beat this whole affair together with a fork until homogenous. The only other thing you're gonna want to add is a whole lot of freshly ground black pepper. We're not adding any salt yet because guanciale can vary in saltiness, and we don't want to oversalt our dish. Beat that together until well incorporated, and then it's time to head over to the stovetop, where we are introducing the guanciale to a cold pan. We're then gonna turn the heat to medium. This is gonna cook the guanciale more slowly, and allow more of its fat to render out, which, in traditional Carbonara, is a good thing. Once it is fully cooked, but not too crispy, we're gonna kill the heat and put our pasta in the hot tub. The water is salato come in mare, or as salty as the sea. And we gotta keep it moving to prevent it from sticking together. And then, a cool trick to determine pasta's doneness, is to take out a strand and eat it, see if it's done. Don't throw it against the wall, you friggin' weirdo. As you can see, our pork jala has almost entirely stopped bubbling. That's exactly where we want it to be. And as soon as the pasta's done, we're dumping it directly into the saute pan with the guanciale. Once all the pasta has been added, we're going to toss it around in the pan, ensuring that it is evenly covered in all that guanciale fat. And you wanna work quickly here, because the only thing that's going to cook our egg slurry and make it smooth and creamy is the residual heat from the pasta. So waste no time getting the egg and cheese mixture in there, and then agitate rigorously. This is going to help emulsify the sauce and keep it creamy and prevent it from curdling. If you find that it's not as smooth as you'd like, you can add a little bit of pasta water, like a quarter cup. But ideally, it should look just like this. Now we're gonna taste for seasoning. Mine needs a little bit of salt. Then you can optionally toss the pasta. This is gonna help aerate it a little bit, get that sauce super creamy. And then, finally, it's time to plate up. I like to use a carving fork to twirl the pasta into a giant cylinder, like this one, for presentation on a long, narrow plate. We are then, of course, going to want to top this hedonistic helix with the remaining guanciale from the bottom of the pan, along with any remnants of that creamy sauce. And there you have it, folks. I'm gonna say it one last time. Carbonara. In its purest, most authentic and traditional form. Unless, of course, I got something wrong, in which case I'm in trouble. But at this point, I'm gonna ask all Italians to leave the room, because it's time to make carbonara. This starts very much the same way, with Parmesan and Romano cheese grated into a bowl, along with three eggs and one egg yolk, beaten together with a few healthy twists of freshly ground black pepper. Now, when most Americans make carbonara, they reach for the bacon. If you can't find guanciale or pancetta and you gotta use bacon, just go for the thickcut stuff. And, likewise, we're gonna slice about half a pound of it into big old chunks. Then, likewise, we're gonna start these guys off in a cold pan, because we want to render out as much fat as possible, but not for the same reason. You'll also notice that I'm using a nonstick pan. That's because, in stainless, bacon can leave a lot of fond on the bottom of the pot, which, for once, we don't want, as it might make our final pasta look kinda dirty. Once the bacon is fully cooked and the fat rendered out, we are going to strain it, because this version of carbonara is going to have a much lighter sauce. We're just gonna strain off all but about two tablespoons worth of bacon fat, which we're gonna leave in the pan, and then we're gonna return it over mediumlow heat to add the most egregious ingredient of all, garlic. Oohhoohoohoohoohoo. This is considered sacrilege in the world of carbonara, but I think it tastes really, really good, and so will you. We're just sauting for one minute until fragrant, before killing the heat. Next up, I see far too many people just dump pasta out of the box in the water, which inevitably leads to disaster. Give this a shot, where you dump the pasta in the palm of your hand, and then pull it out, using your hand like a real gentleman. And as you can see, this time I'm going with bucatini. Next up, just like last time, we're adding the pasta directly to the pan, but this time we're gonna add about a third of a cup of starchy pasta water, which is gonna help make a cohesive sauce. Then we are adding the egg and cheese mixture to the party, and if you find yourself in a pickle like this, where your pan is too small to toss the pasta, no biggie, just dump it back into the emptied pasta pot. Just make sure that you keep it moving, because there's a lot of residual heat in here, and we don't want to end up with pasta and scrambled eggs. So just wildly agitate that around, and then it's time to taste for seasoning. Add salt and pepper as necessary, and assess your sauce's thickness. If it's not quite thick enough, you can rescue it with a little bit of finely grated parmesan. Just add maybe another quarter ounce or so, and mix rigorously. And now it's time to plate up, and one thing you'll notice about this carbonara, is that the sauce is much lighter, because it has a lot less fat. It also stays creamier longer, and won't congeal as quickly as carbonara. And the bucatini, while a little bit difficult to get on one's fork, is dense and chewy and lovely. Whichever version of carbonara you decide to make for yourself, I hope this has shown you how easy it can be, so long as you follow a few simple tricks. Now go out there, get some pasta, and start rolling your R's. For more recipes and tips, visit www.carrera.de```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```I'm Frank Proto, professional chef and culinary instructor, and today we're gonna make foolproof carbonara. I'm gonna teach you how to make carbonara that's luscious, creamy, and full of flavor. This is Carbonara 101. Carbonara is one of those dishes that can seem super complicated, but in the end, it's really easy, and all you really need is a few techniques. If you follow all of my techniques, it'll be foolproof every single time. One of the most important ingredients in carbonara is black peppercorns. Now, I like to grind my own, but before I grind them, I like to toast them, and toasting is gonna give us this really nice, nutty, deep black pepper flavor. So put it over kind of mediumlow heat, and we're just gonna put the peppercorns in until I start to smell that they're fragrant. It's just a subtle nuance that makes this dish so much better. Make sure we're moving our peppercorns around so that they toast evenly. So what I'm looking for here is that I can smell my peppercorns getting fragrant. They start to kind of move around in the pan a little. You'll see that they'll jump a little, right? We might hear a little pop, and once I hear that first popping, I take it off. I don't really wanna go any further than that, because then we're gonna get it overcooked. I'm gonna let these cool on this tray, and in the meantime, I'm gonna start prepping my other ingredients. One of the keys to a foolproof carbonara is to gather all of your ingredients. You need everything within arm's reach. So when I cook my pasta, I'm not waiting for anything. I can make it right away. Now that my peppercorns have cooled, I can crush them. Now, you can use a pepper grinder if you want, but I'm gonna use the old classic technique. I get the pan. I hold it down with my hand here, body weight down. So I'm pushing and rolling. Almost like you're doing a lever, right? I'm pushing down on this side and crushing my peppercorns and rolling. So I can smell, as I crush, that these are super fragrant, super nutty. That toasting brings out those flavors. We get the oils out. And I don't want this to be super fine. I want it to have some texture to it. We're talking about how to take this dish from just kind of a standard dish to just that much better. And as a chef, grating your own cheese is super important. For my carbonara, I choose to use two cheeses. I'm using Parmesan cheese and I'm using Pecorino. And I do buy the good stuff for this. I go to the Italian cheeses. If you can get it, go for the best cheese you can find. I like to use a microplane for this. Now, a microplane is a very fine grater. When this cheese melts, I want it to be nice and fine. I don't wanna get shreds in there. I wanna get this beautiful, fine cheese that's gonna make my sauce super silky in the end. What I like about using two cheeses here is the Parmesan gives me a nice nuttiness and it gives me a really great kind of earthy flavor, whereas the Pecorino is super sharp and it's got a lot of bite to it. So look, I have a lot of cheese here and that's a good thing. That's what I want. So this is for about four servings. Now that my cheese is grated, I can get to my eggs. For carbonara, I like my eggs to be room temperature. So what I'll do is I'll set them on the counter for about a half hour before I make the dish. Because if they're cold, that's gonna slow everything down. I'm gonna put hot pasta and cold eggs and the dish isn't gonna come together and emulsify right. So eggs are the binder for this dish. This is what brings the whole thing together. And I'm going to use three whole eggs and two egg yolks. And what I like to do is crack my egg in half and just run my yolk between the shells until the white all runs out all the way. A lot of times people will just use straight eggs for this and that's okay, but the yolk is a lot of fat and the white is a lot of liquid. So by adding the extra yolk, I'm adding more fat to the dish, more richness to the dish. The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix my eggs and cheese together. And this is a really important step because I want this to be a smooth and creamy sauce around my pasta. We wanna get this into a nice homogenous mixture so that when we actually add the pasta to it, we don't get scrambled eggs. Not a good look for carbonara. All right, so let's just take the cheese, dump it into the eggs and we can just get this together. And you'll see, it's gonna get kind of like a thick, creamy mixture. Get that all in there. I use a whisk just to get this together, but I'm not gonna use a whisk past this point. But you can see, the mixture looks nice and creamy. It's come together. There's no bits of eggs or bits of cheese that aren't mixed in. And that's what I want. This is super important getting your carbonara to the right finished texture. At this point, I wanna add a little bit of my toasted black peppercorns, right? Give it a shake. Get a little bit of your finely ground stuff. Get a little bit of your bigger chunks. So my egg and cheese mixture is ready to go. And now it's time for the star of the show, the guanciale. And this is super traditional for carbonara. Now, if you don't have guanciale, if you can't find it where you're at, you can use pancetta. I've seen bacon be used. Traditionally, guanciale is used for carbonara. And that's the jowl or the cheek of the pig that's being cured, salt cured. Sometimes they rub it in spices and sometimes in peppercorn, but it's just cured. It's salty, it's fatty, it's delicious. And that's why they use it. It has that fattiness. When we cook it out, we get a lot of fat that helps make our sauce smooth and creamy. When it comes to guanciale, I like nice big chunks of it. So I like to cut my own. I don't like to buy a precut. So I wanna get nice matchsticks or big mordones or chunks. Don't be shy. I want them to be super visible in my dish. So you see I have kind of like this matchstick or a very thick matchstick. So we're gonna cut those into nice chunks. I don't want any wimpy little chunks. I wanna see this guanciale. It's a beautiful ingredient. It's got some meat on it, but it's not super meaty. Now that I have my guanciale cut, my eggs, cheese, and pepper mixture, we are ready to make our carbonara. You'll notice in front of me, I have all the ingredients I need within arm's reach. This is one of those things as a chef that you have to set yourself up for. It's proper mise en place. My water is boiling. I'm going to add some salt to my water. I want my water to be basically sea salty. And I'm using dry pasta. It holds the sauce really well. I like to use spaghetti for this. I like the shape. I like the way it holds onto the sauce. I like the bite to it. Pasta's gonna take about 10 minutes, and in that time, I'm going to get my guanciale ready to go. So turn your heat on. I like to use a little olive oil in my pan before I start cooking my guanciale. People will say, but Chef Frank, the guanciale has a lot of fat. I like to put this in the pan to get the process going quicker. My guanciale is gonna brown a little more evenly. I don't really have to wait for that fat to render out. So a little bit of fat in my pan to start is the way that I always go. We're gonna cook this until it is light golden brown. You can hear it start to sizzle. I don't want this to be crisp. I want it to have some chew to it in the end. So we're not gonna brown it all the way. We want to keep all the fat. A lot of people say, whoa, that's a lot of fat. We're gonna put that in the pasta? Yes, we're using all the fat. The fat is key to this dish. It's also going to emulsify with the egg yolks and make this sauce super creamy. Don't forget to get in there and stir your pasta occasionally. We don't want it sticking. Well, how do you tell if pasta's done? If you look at it right now, it's still very firm, right? We want it to be nice and al dente, which means to the tooth. We don't want it to be overcooked. We want it to have a little bite to it. My guanciale is ready to go. You can see it's still bubbling away. It's not completely done, but if I leave it in the pan and keep it hot, it's gonna continue to cook. I don't want it to get any more crisp than this. So I think my pasta is ready. The best way to determine if it is, is to take a piece, try not to burn yourself, and actually taste it. And that's good to go. A lot of people will mix carbonara in a pan, and I don't like doing it in a pan, right? Pans retain heat. I'm afraid my eggs might overcook and get scrambled. So I like to mix everything in the bowl that I mix the cheese and eggs in. So let's take our pasta out, right? I drain it, but I don't drain it too well. We wanna get a little bit of that pasta water in there. The pasta water has starch. It has a little bit of salt. So this goes right into my eggs. And this is gonna start that process of cooking those eggs. And then guanciale and all the fat goes in. Don't be shy. And then we mix. I have a pair of tongs. And here's the key here. We want to mix, mix, mix, right? We want that egg and that cheese to start to cook. We want that fat to be emulsified into the sauce. But look at that, right? Super creamy. Those eggs start to cook. It smells cheesy. Oh my gosh. Nice big chunks of the guanciale, which this is the important part here. We're emulsifying the sauce around the pasta. All of that fat from the guanciale is getting in there. And we get this beautiful, luscious, creamy sauce. Look at that. It's almost like magic when this sauce comes together. Give it a little twist. I'm gonna take some of my guanciale, put it on top, right? Get some of that creamy guanciale from the bottom. I'm gonna take a little more of my toasted black peppercorns and just a little more of my pecorino and Parmesan cheese as if there wasn't enough already. And that is foolproof carbonara. Time to dig in. I'm so excited. This is one of those dishes that waits for no man, woman, or child. You want to make sure you eat it while it's hot and ready to go. Make sure you get a little bit of everything in there. Mm. The sauce is silky and creamy because I took the time to get everything mixed really well. The guanciale has some chew to it. We get a little bit of spiciness from that black peppercorn and the mixture of both cheeses, sharp and kind of earthy, I think makes this carbonara one of the best versions you'll ever have. Mm. It's not complicated. It takes a little technique, a little bit of love, and just makes every part of you happy. Not only your tummy, but your soul as well.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Fai schifo cucinare, ja totalmente schifo! Today we're not making spaghetti carbonara. Some might say it looks like carbonara, and tastes like carbonara, and has the mouthfeel of carbonara, the substances which make up carbonara, and even the personality of carbonara. But this is not carbonara. The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon. That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares. Now let's just fix that. Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months. It sounds like an overreaction at first, but the crack sends a shock wave through the noodle, rendering it completely inedible. I mean look, here's uncracked spaghetti and cracked spaghetti. If I didn't tell you that was spaghetti, you wouldn't have even recognized it. Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti. Keep wang jangling that for the first bit to keep the spag from getting clingy. By the way, spaghetti gets its name because you put it in the spa to cook it. Now our bacon is cooked. We're turning the burner off, waiting for this to cool, at least until there's no sizzle left, and a bit longer so we don't overcook the eggbased sauce. Now I'm gonna put in a bit of pasta water into our sauce ingredients to get that cheeseahead start on the melting. Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation. Since noodles are made of wheat, this is essentially a bacon sandwich, but if you do strain the spaghetti, make sure to set aside some pasta water, and if you get the kind of spaghetti with dehydrated meatballs, just pull those out and set them aside. Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water making this nice and creamy. The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink. Here I'm trying to do that fancy twist thing, but it's not the right tool, and I don't know what I'm doing. We'll finish with some pepper pepper pepper and some more pecorino or parmesan, and here we don't have carbonara. If you want to really see not carbonara, here's an earlier attempt where I used whole egg. Too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great. So are the whims of the food gods. If this was carbonara, you'd have to be careful, because the carbonistic properties are so fragile that if you put in a single pea, it would no longer be carbonara. It's a mysterious chemical reaction that only Italian scientists understand. I'm craving carbonara, but I don't have guanciale. Should I really even bother? Oh no, will they judge my carbonara? Because I want some cream upon it. Should I eat it in the closet? Oh no, what have I done? I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetable free. They say it's no game. Hang my head as I eat this not carbonara in shame.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```You need to understand, carbonara does not need cream, or peas, or ham, or whatever else people are putting in it. It's so simple! Today, hang out for a second, and you're gonna learn how to do it right. Let's not waste any time, now let's go! Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured. So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon. And thickcut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta. So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way. That's about three quarters of an inch. Turn this pan on to medium heat. I'm doing a tiny bit of olive oil, I don't think it's traditional, but when I'm cooking Italian food, it just feels right. Then go ahead and break your bacon into that pan, and what we're gonna do here is slowly render out the fat from this bacon, get it nice and crispy. We'll use most of it in the pasta, and then we'll actually use some for garnish, because who doesn't like crispy bacon on top? Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit, about a tablespoon of salt, kosher salt, into about four quarts of water. Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water. So first is very important, we need to talk about the cheese. Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged. I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in. As you can see, there's a lot of fat coming out of this bacon. Just want to turn this occasionally. And we are going to be using some, but not all of this fat in the actual spaghetti carbonara. Another thing you can do is just take a little bit of that boiling water and add it to the eggs. Quickly whisk that in. We're kind of equalizing the temperatures here and loosening up this egg mixture a little bit, and it's going to make the whole pasta come together a lot easier in the end. I put just about a quarter cup in here. Our bacon is almost rendered, so now we'll drop our spaghetti. We'll try to do that twisty thing. Kind of worked. Just get a little bit of water up on it. Let that roll. Check it on the bacon. I turned the heat down in the end. Be careful not to overcook this. Looks pretty much perfect. First, I'm going to take some out for garnish. Drain it on a paper towel. Now I'm turning off the heat of this pan, and I'm going to drain off most of the fat, all except for about two tablespoons or so. And then just set that back over there. Remember, now, heat is off. This is so important. Okay, and of course, we're going to put some olive oil in this pasta. No, we're not going to do that. Why do people do that? It's a myth. It's a myth. Just like MSG is going to give you cancer or whatever. It's just not true, and it serves no purpose. So don't do it. Don't do it, okay? Another thing I want to share with you, there are tons of expensive pasta brands out in the world, but honestly, like, I like these cheap Italian brands, like this one, Giacchecco. I don't know how to say it, but like, I don't know why. I just prefer the cheap one. So if anyone's wondering, this is what I use. So we'll cook this spaghetti about 10 minutes in this pot, just slightly al dente, and then we'll finish it over in this baking pan. Remember, still no heat on this pan. I'm going to explain all this soon, but you want to leave this water in this pot. This will make sense in a minute. So here we go. It's been 10 minutes. We're just going to use our tongs here. Drop that in there. Trust me, this spaghetti is generating a ridiculous amount of heat. Turn that pasta water down to a simmer. Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture. The whole trick here, and what you really need to keep in mind is that we do not want to scramble these eggs. The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right? And don't worry, you're not eating raw eggs. And gentle with the pasta. You don't want to break it. Oh, man. And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta. You see how creamy this is? I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat. So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture. But I don't think I even really need to do this. But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this. Oh, my God. Looks so good. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water. That's going to loosen it up. And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream. Done. No scramble, nothing. Go ahead and plate this up. Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man. Now to finish a little more pan migliano reggiano. All over, nothing wrong with that. And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch. That is a bonus no one is going to complain about. Trust me. I mean, how bad do you want to tuck into this treat? Allow me to try it. Oh, allow me to try it for you. Here we go. A little bacon. Oh, gosh. I see a lot of people who leave my YouTube videos right now. It's such a big mistake. They obviously don't know about the fridge. Oh, God, that's good. You've got to make this. Here's my rolling pin. I just feel like this is what an Italian grandmother would do. Whew. What? Well, I hope that helped. Until next time, my friends, you know I love you when I'm out.```"

But it's really controversial. I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe. So first up guys, you only need five ingredients. Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork. And as you can see, it's all about the fat. It's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried and it's aged. Of course, it's similar to smoked bacon and you can get some pretty good results actually. But you can see this is quite lean. So try and get them to not cut off the fat because you need it. Or there's pancetta. Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano. Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg. Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic. So first up guys, grab the pasta by two hands. Twist it into the water. By twisting it, it won't stick together. Put a tiny amount of salt in this water because the cheese and the guanciale is salty. This beautiful pasta takes eight minutes to cook. So I've got my guanciale. I'm gonna remove the skin and I'm gonna take a nice centimetre slice of the guanciale. Roughly chop this to about half centimetre chunks. Now, the pan is cold. Turn it on to a mediumhigh heat. The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out. The guanciale goes in to the pan and this pan is getting hot. Give the garlic a crack and then put it in the pan. As this starts to sizzle, the fat will just pull out some of that perfume from the garlic. Then there's the black pepper. Get your peppercorns in a pestle and mortar. Crack it. Get a little sieve. This is one of the most important little bits and no one really does it, okay. Honestly, this is the outer skin. This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter. Perfect for a good hot carbonara. The guanciale is getting golden. Now, let's get on to the eggs. Eggs are really, really delicate and if you don't treat these right, you end up with stirfried noodles and we don't want that. I'm gonna take a bowl and I'm gonna crack the egg straight into there and I'm just gonna add a little pecorino to that. So, like 20 grams. Now, we're time sensitive so we're gonna have a little whisk up. We've got dark guanciale. We've got the fat that's come out of it and that's what you want. You want attitude and colour. Now, I'm gonna remove that garlic. Turn the heat off and you're gonna drag the pasta and the water into the pan. Use the water to stop the frying. Bit of water, bit of water. That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce. We're not frying anymore. Can you hear that? Quiet. No frying at all. Only then can we think about adding our egg. As we toss, we add some more liquid. That's the cream. You get the cream through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat and technique and timing. So, as simple as this is, it's technical. Get your friends, your family, get them around the table. Glass of wine. Look at that guys, look at that. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper. I'm so excited. Spaghetti, carbonara with a beautiful little finishing of pecorino. That is as classic as I can give you guys, from chefs, from nonnas. It's about quality ingredients, the guanciale, the pecorino romana, quality eggs, the pepper, the technique of the pepper, good pasta and then the sensitivity of cooking it right. Come on. There's a little platter for two people and of course, the most important thing when you eat pasta is don't watch it, eat it. Mmm. That my friends, is a thing of joy.```"

  "procedure": "The process begins with preparing the pasta by twisting it into boiling water with a little salt. Guanciale is sliced and cooked in a cold pan to render the fat, with garlic and cracked black pepper added for flavor. Eggs are mixed with pecorino cheese. Once the guanciale is golden, the pasta is added to the pan with some cooking water to create an emulsion. The heat is turned off before adding the egg mixture to form a creamy sauce.

    "content": "Contents:\n```I am Antonio Carluccio. Welcome to my kitchen. I show you how to make the real Carbonara. Most of the people, they get it wrong, and I will show you why. Now, this is boiling water to which we add in the ratio of 10 grams per liter of water, salt. Has to be like this. And immediately then, we put in, has to be boiling, a pasta. In this case, it's sort of spaghettoni, the biggest size of spaghetti. While this is cooking, it takes good 10 minutes, and no oil, please. No oil, because you don't need it. You just need to stir a little bit when it's in it, and that's it. Now, for the original Carbonara, you need the guanciale, which is the cheek, the pork cheek. And the Romans, they're very special in that because they do it, they cure it like ham, or like pancetta, and it's very tender, very tasty and tender. Now, you have to cut it in chunks. You can use naturally also pancetta, the normal pancetta, which is this one here. But I like the guanciale when I have it, obviously. And this is the recipe for two people. Big chunks. The Romans, they are mad for this pasta. If there is a Roman pasta, it is this one here. This is quite a lot for two people, let's see. And the only thing you have to do now to make the sauce is to take good olive oil, put it in the pan. There you are. Put the guanciale into that, and this is the beginning of the sauce, and mostly also the end of it. Because the rest is coming here into that bowl. And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs. Oh, lovely colour, look at this. To be a little bit naughty, I take just the yolk, and we beat it. To this, you don't add any, any, any cream. Absolutely forbidden. So this is the beginning of the sauce. So we put a little bit of parmesan. In Roma, they use also pecorino cheese, which is a cheese to be grated. There are fresh pecorino and aged pecorino. But it's lovely to have a little bit of this. Abundant pepper. And another stir. And this is the sauce. I wouldn't put any salt here because the bacon here is quite salty, it's preserved. We reduce it a little bit because I'm going to see what the pasta does. I can see it is still stiff. So I put it back again another three or four minutes. Now here's the bacon that has produced also quite a lot of fat. Should you be not wanting the fat, I show you a little trick. Here we are. And do this. You absorb a little bit of the fat, and you take it off like this. Very simple. So the pasta seems to be doing well here, the taste now should be enough. I switched off the guanciale because it's too hot and this is exactly what I don't want to be too hot. So now I take the pasta and I put it into the, yes, that. And you flavour it like this. You let it cool down in doing this. And it shouldn't be too hot because what is going to happen now should be the temperature enough to coat the egg around the pasta. And now it comes, yes, the resistance, the actual sauce. There you are. And now we stir it like this. You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs. Not too scrambly. And this is the carbonara. And now the last touch, which is the embellishment. Parmesan or pecorino, depending what you like. And in my opinion also a nice touch of pepper. This is decoration for me. And this is the real carbonara. The only one. And it's exactly how it should be. Creamy, without adding cream because this is the usual thing. Like this is just fantastic. Cameraman, everybody, you should taste it. It's just wonderful.```"

Since then, I've dreamt of nothing but redemption, so today we're going to take a crack at two different versions of Carbonara, a realdeal, oldschool Italian version, and a more modern, less traditional version that's sure to piss them off. Let's get down to basics. Carbonara Alright, so before we can make Carbonara, we've got to make Carbonara, which, by definition, is made with guanciale, a type of cured pork jowl. It is very delicious, but a little hard to find, so if you can't find it, you can sub with pancetta if you're in a pinch. I've got maybe a half pound here that I'm gonna cut into relatively sizable chunks, and then set aside to make one of the essential elements of any Carbonara dish, the egg slurry. Into a medium bowl or measuring cup goes three large eggs and one egg yolk for a little added richness. And then it's time to finely grate and measure out four ounces of cheese. Truly traditional Carbonara uses 100 Pecorino Romano cheese, but is commonly balanced out with ParmigianoReggiano. If you want it a little less sharp and a little more nutty, I'm going for a 5050 ratio, into which I'm going to dump our beaten eggs. We're then going to beat this whole affair together with a fork until homogenous. The only other thing you're gonna want to add is a whole lot of freshly ground black pepper. We're not adding any salt yet because guanciale can vary in saltiness, and we don't want to oversalt our dish. Beat that together until well incorporated, and then it's time to head over to the stovetop, where we are introducing the guanciale to a cold pan. We're then gonna turn the heat to medium. This is gonna cook the guanciale more slowly, and allow more of its fat to render out, which, in traditional Carbonara, is a good thing. Once it is fully cooked, but not too crispy, we're gonna kill the heat and put our pasta in the hot tub. The water is salato come in mare, or as salty as the sea. And we gotta keep it moving to prevent it from sticking together. And then, a cool trick to determine pasta's doneness, is to take out a strand and eat it, see if it's done. Don't throw it against the wall, you friggin' weirdo. As you can see, our pork jala has almost entirely stopped bubbling. That's exactly where we want it to be. And as soon as the pasta's done, we're dumping it directly into the saute pan with the guanciale. Once all the pasta has been added, we're going to toss it around in the pan, ensuring that it is evenly covered in all that guanciale fat. And you wanna work quickly here, because the only thing that's going to cook our egg slurry and make it smooth and creamy is the residual heat from the pasta. So waste no time getting the egg and cheese mixture in there, and then agitate rigorously. This is going to help emulsify the sauce and keep it creamy and prevent it from curdling. If you find that it's not as smooth as you'd like, you can add a little bit of pasta water, like a quarter cup. But ideally, it should look just like this. Now we're gonna taste for seasoning. Mine needs a little bit of salt. Then you can optionally toss the pasta. This is gonna help aerate it a little bit, get that sauce super creamy. And then, finally, it's time to plate up. I like to use a carving fork to twirl the pasta into a giant cylinder, like this one, for presentation on a long, narrow plate. We are then, of course, going to want to top this hedonistic helix with the remaining guanciale from the bottom of the pan, along with any remnants of that creamy sauce. And there you have it, folks. I'm gonna say it one last time. Carbonara. In its purest, most authentic and traditional form. Unless, of course, I got something wrong, in which case I'm in trouble. But at this point, I'm gonna ask all Italians to leave the room, because it's time to make carbonara. This starts very much the same way, with Parmesan and Romano cheese grated into a bowl, along with three eggs and one egg yolk, beaten together with a few healthy twists of freshly ground black pepper. Now, when most Americans make carbonara, they reach for the bacon. If you can't find guanciale or pancetta and you gotta use bacon, just go for the thickcut stuff. And, likewise, we're gonna slice about half a pound of it into big old chunks. Then, likewise, we're gonna start these guys off in a cold pan, because we want to render out as much fat as possible, but not for the same reason. You'll also notice that I'm using a nonstick pan. That's because, in stainless, bacon can leave a lot of fond on the bottom of the pot, which, for once, we don't want, as it might make our final pasta look kinda dirty. Once the bacon is fully cooked and the fat rendered out, we are going to strain it, because this version of carbonara is going to have a much lighter sauce. We're just gonna strain off all but about two tablespoons worth of bacon fat, which we're gonna leave in the pan, and then we're gonna return it over mediumlow heat to add the most egregious ingredient of all, garlic. Oohhoohoohoohoohoo. This is considered sacrilege in the world of carbonara, but I think it tastes really, really good, and so will you. We're just sauting for one minute until fragrant, before killing the heat. Next up, I see far too many people just dump pasta out of the box in the water, which inevitably leads to disaster. Give this a shot, where you dump the pasta in the palm of your hand, and then pull it out, using your hand like a real gentleman. And as you can see, this time I'm going with bucatini. Next up, just like last time, we're adding the pasta directly to the pan, but this time we're gonna add about a third of a cup of starchy pasta water, which is gonna help make a cohesive sauce. Then we are adding the egg and cheese mixture to the party, and if you find yourself in a pickle like this, where your pan is too small to toss the pasta, no biggie, just dump it back into the emptied pasta pot. Just make sure that you keep it moving, because there's a lot of residual heat in here, and we don't want to end up with pasta and scrambled eggs. So just wildly agitate that around, and then it's time to taste for seasoning. Add salt and pepper as necessary, and assess your sauce's thickness. If it's not quite thick enough, you can rescue it with a little bit of finely grated parmesan. Just add maybe another quarter ounce or so, and mix rigorously. And now it's time to plate up, and one thing you'll notice about this carbonara, is that the sauce is much lighter, because it has a lot less fat. It also stays creamier longer, and won't congeal as quickly as carbonara. And the bucatini, while a little bit difficult to get on one's fork, is dense and chewy and lovely. Whichever version of carbonara you decide to make for yourself, I hope this has shown you how easy it can be, so long as you follow a few simple tricks. Now go out there, get some pasta, and start rolling your R's. For more recipes and tips, visit www.carrera.de```"

RESPONSE: {
  "goal": "The main purpose of the video is to demonstrate how to make two versions of Pasta Carbonara: a traditional Italian version and a modern, less traditional version.",
  "procedure": "The process begins with preparing the key ingredients: guanciale or pancetta, eggs, and cheese. For the traditional version, guanciale is cooked slowly to render fat, and pasta is cooked and combined with an egg and cheese mixture using the pasta's residual heat to create a creamy sauce. The modern version uses bacon and adds garlic, with a lighter sauce achieved by straining excess fat and using pasta water.",
  "outcome": "The final outcome is two distinct versions of Pasta Carbonara: a traditional version with a rich, creamy sauce and a modern version with a lighter sauce and additional flavors like garlic."

    "content": "Contents:\n```I'm Frank Proto, professional chef and culinary instructor, and today we're gonna make foolproof carbonara. I'm gonna teach you how to make carbonara that's luscious, creamy, and full of flavor. This is Carbonara 101. Carbonara is one of those dishes that can seem super complicated, but in the end, it's really easy, and all you really need is a few techniques. If you follow all of my techniques, it'll be foolproof every single time. One of the most important ingredients in carbonara is black peppercorns. Now, I like to grind my own, but before I grind them, I like to toast them, and toasting is gonna give us this really nice, nutty, deep black pepper flavor. So put it over kind of mediumlow heat, and we're just gonna put the peppercorns in until I start to smell that they're fragrant. It's just a subtle nuance that makes this dish so much better. Make sure we're moving our peppercorns around so that they toast evenly. So what I'm looking for here is that I can smell my peppercorns getting fragrant. They start to kind of move around in the pan a little. You'll see that they'll jump a little, right? We might hear a little pop, and once I hear that first popping, I take it off. I don't really wanna go any further than that, because then we're gonna get it overcooked. I'm gonna let these cool on this tray, and in the meantime, I'm gonna start prepping my other ingredients. One of the keys to a foolproof carbonara is to gather all of your ingredients. You need everything within arm's reach. So when I cook my pasta, I'm not waiting for anything. I can make it right away. Now that my peppercorns have cooled, I can crush them. Now, you can use a pepper grinder if you want, but I'm gonna use the old classic technique. I get the pan. I hold it down with my hand here, body weight down. So I'm pushing and rolling. Almost like you're doing a lever, right? I'm pushing down on this side and crushing my peppercorns and rolling. So I can smell, as I crush, that these are super fragrant, super nutty. That toasting brings out those flavors. We get the oils out. And I don't want this to be super fine. I want it to have some texture to it. We're talking about how to take this dish from just kind of a standard dish to just that much better. And as a chef, grating your own cheese is super important. For my carbonara, I choose to use two cheeses. I'm using Parmesan cheese and I'm using Pecorino. And I do buy the good stuff for this. I go to the Italian cheeses. If you can get it, go for the best cheese you can find. I like to use a microplane for this. Now, a microplane is a very fine grater. When this cheese melts, I want it to be nice and fine. I don't wanna get shreds in there. I wanna get this beautiful, fine cheese that's gonna make my sauce super silky in the end. What I like about using two cheeses here is the Parmesan gives me a nice nuttiness and it gives me a really great kind of earthy flavor, whereas the Pecorino is super sharp and it's got a lot of bite to it. So look, I have a lot of cheese here and that's a good thing. That's what I want. So this is for about four servings. Now that my cheese is grated, I can get to my eggs. For carbonara, I like my eggs to be room temperature. So what I'll do is I'll set them on the counter for about a half hour before I make the dish. Because if they're cold, that's gonna slow everything down. I'm gonna put hot pasta and cold eggs and the dish isn't gonna come together and emulsify right. So eggs are the binder for this dish. This is what brings the whole thing together. And I'm going to use three whole eggs and two egg yolks. And what I like to do is crack my egg in half and just run my yolk between the shells until the white all runs out all the way. A lot of times people will just use straight eggs for this and that's okay, but the yolk is a lot of fat and the white is a lot of liquid. So by adding the extra yolk, I'm adding more fat to the dish, more richness to the dish. The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix my eggs and cheese together. And this is a really important step because I want this to be a smooth and creamy sauce around my pasta. We wanna get this into a nice homogenous mixture so that when we actually add the pasta to it, we don't get scrambled eggs. Not a good look for carbonara. All right, so let's just take the cheese, dump it into the eggs and we can just get this together. And you'll see, it's gonna get kind of like a thick, creamy mixture. Get that all in there. I use a whisk just to get this together, but I'm not gonna use a whisk past this point. But you can see, the mixture looks nice and creamy. It's come together. There's no bits of eggs or bits of cheese that aren't mixed in. And that's what I want. This is super important getting your carbonara to the right finished texture. At this point, I wanna add a little bit of my toasted black peppercorns, right? Give it a shake. Get a little bit of your finely ground stuff. Get a little bit of your bigger chunks. So my egg and cheese mixture is ready to go. And now it's time for the star of the show, the guanciale. And this is super traditional for carbonara. Now, if you don't have guanciale, if you can't find it where you're at, you can use pancetta. I've seen bacon be used. Traditionally, guanciale is used for carbonara. And that's the jowl or the cheek of the pig that's being cured, salt cured. Sometimes they rub it in spices and sometimes in peppercorn, but it's just cured. It's salty, it's fatty, it's delicious. And that's why they use it. It has that fattiness. When we cook it out, we get a lot of fat that helps make our sauce smooth and creamy. When it comes to guanciale, I like nice big chunks of it. So I like to cut my own. I don't like to buy a precut. So I wanna get nice matchsticks or big mordones or chunks. Don't be shy. I want them to be super visible in my dish. So you see I have kind of like this matchstick or a very thick matchstick. So we're gonna cut those into nice chunks. I don't want any wimpy little chunks. I wanna see this guanciale. It's a beautiful ingredient. It's got some meat on it, but it's not super meaty. Now that I have my guanciale cut, my eggs, cheese, and pepper mixture, we are ready to make our carbonara. You'll notice in front of me, I have all the ingredients I need within arm's reach. This is one of those things as a chef that you have to set yourself up for. It's proper mise en place. My water is boiling. I'm going to add some salt to my water. I want my water to be basically sea salty. And I'm using dry pasta. It holds the sauce really well. I like to use spaghetti for this. I like the shape. I like the way it holds onto the sauce. I like the bite to it. Pasta's gonna take about 10 minutes, and in that time, I'm going to get my guanciale ready to go. So turn your heat on. I like to use a little olive oil in my pan before I start cooking my guanciale. People will say, but Chef Frank, the guanciale has a lot of fat. I like to put this in the pan to get the process going quicker. My guanciale is gonna brown a little more evenly. I don't really have to wait for that fat to render out. So a little bit of fat in my pan to start is the way that I always go. We're gonna cook this until it is light golden brown. You can hear it start to sizzle. I don't want this to be crisp. I want it to have some chew to it in the end. So we're not gonna brown it all the way. We want to keep all the fat. A lot of people say, whoa, that's a lot of fat. We're gonna put that in the pasta? Yes, we're using all the fat. The fat is key to this dish. It's also going to emulsify with the egg yolks and make this sauce super creamy. Don't forget to get in there and stir your pasta occasionally. We don't want it sticking. Well, how do you tell if pasta's done? If you look at it right now, it's still very firm, right? We want it to be nice and al dente, which means to the tooth. We don't want it to be overcooked. We want it to have a little bite to it. My guanciale is ready to go. You can see it's still bubbling away. It's not completely done, but if I leave it in the pan and keep it hot, it's gonna continue to cook. I don't want it to get any more crisp than this. So I think my pasta is ready. The best way to determine if it is, is to take a piece, try not to burn yourself, and actually taste it. And that's good to go. A lot of people will mix carbonara in a pan, and I don't like doing it in a pan, right? Pans retain heat. I'm afraid my eggs might overcook and get scrambled. So I like to mix everything in the bowl that I mix the cheese and eggs in. So let's take our pasta out, right? I drain it, but I don't drain it too well. We wanna get a little bit of that pasta water in there. The pasta water has starch. It has a little bit of salt. So this goes right into my eggs. And this is gonna start that process of cooking those eggs. And then guanciale and all the fat goes in. Don't be shy. And then we mix. I have a pair of tongs. And here's the key here. We want to mix, mix, mix, right? We want that egg and that cheese to start to cook. We want that fat to be emulsified into the sauce. But look at that, right? Super creamy. Those eggs start to cook. It smells cheesy. Oh my gosh. Nice big chunks of the guanciale, which this is the important part here. We're emulsifying the sauce around the pasta. All of that fat from the guanciale is getting in there. And we get this beautiful, luscious, creamy sauce. Look at that. It's almost like magic when this sauce comes together. Give it a little twist. I'm gonna take some of my guanciale, put it on top, right? Get some of that creamy guanciale from the bottom. I'm gonna take a little more of my toasted black peppercorns and just a little more of my pecorino and Parmesan cheese as if there wasn't enough already. And that is foolproof carbonara. Time to dig in. I'm so excited. This is one of those dishes that waits for no man, woman, or child. You want to make sure you eat it while it's hot and ready to go. Make sure you get a little bit of everything in there. Mm. The sauce is silky and creamy because I took the time to get everything mixed really well. The guanciale has some chew to it. We get a little bit of spiciness from that black peppercorn and the mixture of both cheeses, sharp and kind of earthy, I think makes this carbonara one of the best versions you'll ever have. Mm. It's not complicated. It takes a little technique, a little bit of love, and just makes every part of you happy. Not only your tummy, but your soul as well.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge? Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started. First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top. If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin. Okay, now for the dry ingredients. I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video. It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly. It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour. Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here. I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour. One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin. For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top. Sift it out. We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well. Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside. This was melted a minute ago. It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave. For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold. This counter's freezing. All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk. In you go. Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there. So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming. You wanna say hi? He's eating cookies that I made. One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl. Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together. If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine. I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me. So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream. Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt. It'll be completely delicious still. This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla. That's 15 ml. Wow, delicious. I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this. What's going on here? Look, it's turned into like a butter mush. That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in. You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked. A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems. Okay, a little bit of heat later. Let's give this a whisk. That's nice. Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want. Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined. You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in. So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal. It's time for some chocolate, the best part. All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet. You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer. Here we go. That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I will be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes. Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk. After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins. I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper. It's gonna be different. I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess. All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome. In you go. Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers. Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily. I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way. Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim. Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges. It'll burn. It's just a matter of how it looks. It'll still bake fine. When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount. You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips. After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips. This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference. The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top. Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven. You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome. This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then we'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate. Right, into the oven you go. Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper. Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown. In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge. It's really like soft all over and just delicious. You've gotta take a look at the inside of this. Take a look. If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hey guys, I'm Dina from SimplyHomeCooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins. They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel. So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients. So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture. Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries. The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter. During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour. Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer. So you want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale. Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar. You want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes. So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs. Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream. Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once. So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between. So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter. All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries. And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula. Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop. I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional. Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel. In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar. Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them. Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe. Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking. Now it's time to put together our batter. First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe. The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar. We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together. At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes. After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency. Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds. Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options. For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds. Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula. Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour. You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now. Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in. Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined. Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour. Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in. Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute. Your batter should be thick but also spreadable. We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full. It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins. You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches. Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door. Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven. Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin. This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit. I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt. Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too. Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. Then simply fold this in. Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups. One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top. And then of course bake these just as we did before. Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version. For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it. From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, allpurpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter. Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in. Even though you can mix and match addins you want to total any additions that you make like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit to 1 cup total. Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding. This time you're only going to add in 3 quarters of a cup of granulated sugar because you're going to replace that additional quarter cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors. Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed. You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted. This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts. Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle. So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest. This is the master recipe with no alterations to it. I'm going to add in 1 cup of dried cranberries because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total. That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 1 cup for 1 cup total. I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor. Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed. You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless. Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious. I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. You can use between 1 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon. It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be. Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk. I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays. Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping. A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins. It starts with 1 14 cup of cold cubed butter. Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this. Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand. Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter. It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin. And of course the baking time on all of these are the same. Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe. Thanks for watching. You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge? Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them. Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started. First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top. If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin. Okay, now for the dry ingredients. I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video. It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly. It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour. Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here. I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour. One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin. For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top. Sift it out. We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well. Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside. This was melted a minute ago. It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave. For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold. This counter's freezing. All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk. In you go. Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there. So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming. You wanna say hi? He's eating cookies that I made. One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl. Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together. If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine. I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me. So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream. Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt. It'll be completely delicious still. This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla. That's 15 ml. Wow, delicious. I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this. What's going on here? Look, it's turned into like a butter mush. That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in. You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked. A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems. Okay, a little bit of heat later. Let's give this a whisk. That's nice. Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want. Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined. You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in. So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal. It's time for some chocolate, the best part. All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet. You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer. Here we go. That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I will be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes. Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk. After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins. I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper. It's gonna be different. I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess. All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome. In you go. Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers. Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily. I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way. Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim. Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges. It'll burn. It's just a matter of how it looks. It'll still bake fine. When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount. You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips. After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips. This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference. The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top. Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven. You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome. This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then we'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate. Right, into the oven you go. Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper. Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown. In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge. It's really like soft all over and just delicious. You've gotta take a look at the inside of this. Take a look. If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.

They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel. So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients. So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt. Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture. Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries. The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter. During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour. Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer. So you want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale. Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar. You want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes. So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs. Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream. Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once. So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between. So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter. All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries. And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula. Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop. I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional. Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel. In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar. Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them. Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes. I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes. See you next time!```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe. Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking. Now it's time to put together our batter. First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe. The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar. We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together. At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes. After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency. Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds. Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options. For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds. Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula. Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour. You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now. Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in. Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined. Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour. Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in. Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute. Your batter should be thick but also spreadable. We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full. It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins. You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches. Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door. Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven. Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin. This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit. I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt. Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too. Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. Then simply fold this in. Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups. One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top. And then of course bake these just as we did before. Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version. For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it. From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, allpurpose flour, and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter. Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in. Even though you can mix and match addins you want to total any additions that you make like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit to 1 cup total. Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding. This time you're only going to add in 3 quarters of a cup of granulated sugar because you're going to replace that additional quarter cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors. Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed. You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted. This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts. Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle. So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest. This is the master recipe with no alterations to it. I'm going to add in 1 cup of dried cranberries because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total. That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 1 cup for 1 cup total. I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor. Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed. You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless. Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious. I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. You can use between 1 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon. It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be. Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk. I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays. Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping. A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins. It starts with 1 14 cup of cold cubed butter. Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this. Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand. Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter. It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin. And of course the baking time on all of these are the same. Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe. Thanks for watching.

RESPONSE: {
  "goal": "The main purpose of the video is to teach viewers how to make a versatile Master Muffin Recipe that can be adapted to create various muffin flavors easily.",
  "procedure": "The process begins with preheating the oven and preparing a muffin tin. The base batter is made by creaming butter and sugar, adding eggs, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt, then incorporating flour and milk or buttermilk. The batter is divided into muffin cups and baked. Variations are created by adding different extracts, fruits, chocolate, or spices to the base batter.",
  "outcome": "The outcome is a batch of 12 muffins that can be customized into different flavors such as lemon blueberry, chocolate, pistachio, cranberry white chocolate, and cinnamon, using the master recipe as a base."

    "content": "Contents:\n```Today, you'll learn how to remove objects in Photoshop with ease, even when you're working with complex photos. This technique is one that can work as a standalone method, but can be enhanced with the help of other object removal tools, as you'll learn later in the lesson. Now, we're going to cover a lot in this video, so if you want to make sure that all these techniques stick, be sure to download the free lesson cheat sheet for this video available in the description below. Now, in this example, we're going to remove this car from the background, some of the cars down the street, and then we're going to touch things up with a few additional tools to finalize the result. Now, typically, with object removal tools, something as large as this car would be extremely, extremely difficult to remove, because we don't have enough sample areas to rebuild what was behind this car. But now, with Generative Fill, we can easily create new pixels within this photo to replace whatever was behind this car, or at least make it look like we have replaced it. So, the first thing we need to do in this process is select the Lasso tool. To select the Lasso tool, just press L on your keyboard, or you can find it right here inside of the toolbar. The reason I'm choosing the Lasso tool is because it's really easy to create a general selection around the object that you're trying to replace with Generative Fill. From there, we have a couple important settings up in the Options bar. I'll set the feather to 10 pixels, and then make sure that AntiAliased is checked. Now, we can go and create a selection around the object that we want to remove, which, in this case, is the car. So, I'll go and click and drag around the entire car, just outside of the edge, and that also includes this bumper that is between this gentleman's legs here. So, I'm going to go all the way around, like so, just around the outside edges of the car, giving enough breathing room, so Photoshop can figure out what actually needs to fill in this selection area. With this active selection, we can just go and click on Generative Fill inside of the Contextual taskbar. If you don't see this, just go up to Window, and then down here to the Contextual taskbar to reveal it. So, going ahead and clicking on Generative Fill, we'll then go and click Generate without any specific prompt added. Photoshop will take a minute to load the results, and then it will give us three variations here inside of the Properties panel that we can click between to see which option we like the best. Now, this one looks pretty decent, but the post is in a weird area, so I don't really like how that turned out. I don't like the way this curb is looking here either, so we're actually going to regenerate a few different results for us because all three of these didn't really work out in our favor. So, again, I'll go ahead and click on Generate to create a new set of options for us to choose from. Now, as you can see, we have a new row of variations that we can click between to choose something that we like. In this case, this example actually looks pretty good to me, or even this one here is pretty acceptable as well. I think I'm going to opt for this particular one instead. I think it looks the most seamless overall rather than having to regenerate something else for the sake of example. So, now all of those adjustments were applied onto a new generative fill layer that if I turn this on and off, you can see the before and after. So, what has happened here is that it rebuilt our subject's pants that I don't really like, but we'll touch this up in just a moment. But most importantly, it did a great job to fill in all of this detail that was once behind the car. This would be nearly impossible to replicate with any of the previous object removal tools in Photoshop like the Clone Stamp tool or the Remove tool for example. This is like taking things to a totally new level. Now, before we go and touch up the problem areas, I'm also going to go and remove these cars from the background. So, once again, still with the Lasso tool selected, I'll just click and drag around those cars in the background that I want to remove with the same settings as before so that 10 pixel feather antialias is checked. Once again, I'll click on Generative Fill in the contextual taskbar, then click on Generate while that selection is active and Photoshop will take a minute to load and then fill in that active selection area with something new. Now, with that complete, we can click between our variations until we have something that we're happy with. In this case, the second variation looks best to me, so I'm going to select that one here and again, it's on its own generative fill layer. So, now with this complete, we have to go through and touch up any other smaller areas that we would like to remove as well as fix any problems that we have created within our generative fill layers, such as the top of our subject's leg, for example. Before we get to touching up the leg, we're going to go and remove some of the people in the background of this photo just to make it totally clean. But because these are relatively small areas of the photo, rather than having to use all the computing power and slow down your computer for generative fill, we can just use something like the Remove tool to touch this up. Clicking on the New Layer icon to create a new layer at the top of our layer stack. I'll call this layer to Remove tool. I'll now go ahead and select the Remove tool from the toolbar here and then make sure that Sample All Layers is enabled. From there, I can just go and paint over the subject that I would like to remove or the person in the background and then because I have remove after each brush stroke unchecked, I'm going to go and paint over the next person I want to remove from the background as well. With those two pink highlights added, I'll press Enter and now Photoshop will remove those from my photo super easily. If you want to learn more about the Remove tool specifically, you could check out this video right here where I dive deep into how to use that tool. So now the final thing we have to do is touch up our subject's leg because if I zoom in here, you can see how he kind of has like this bent thigh. It looks like he has a broken leg or something. So what we need to do is create a selection of the original leg to restore it and then we need to touch up the outer edges once again. It sounds a bit complicated, but I promise you it's super easy. So holding Alt or Option, I'll click on the eyeball icon beside my image layer so that now I'm only viewing that layer. With that particular image layer selected, I'm going to go and select the Object Selection tool up here in the toolbar. With the mode set to Lasso, I'm going to click and drag around the area that I want to restore which is my subject's leg. So just click and drag just around the outside edges of that leg like so and then it will snap to the edge of that object. Now with this selection active, I'm going to reenable all of my previous layers by clicking and dragging through the eyeball icons to make them visible once again. Now to restore the contents of this selection area, we need to remove it from our generative fill layer that is causing this problem. So clicking on the generative fill layer that is the one that is removing that car and creating the issue with the leg, I'll click on that layer mask while I have this active selection. I'll then grab my brush tool by pressing B and set my foreground color to black. Now with that generative fill layer mask selected, I can just go and paint inside of this selection area and it's going to restore that leg for me. Now, of course, I still have some areas outside of the selection that are showing through from this generative fill layer. So what we're going to do is invert this selection and then mask out these additional problem areas. So within the contextual taskbar, we can just click on the invert selection option and now we're selecting everything outside of our subject's leg. And with that generative fill layer mask still selected, my foreground color is still set to black, I can now go and just mask out any of those other problem areas around my subject's leg. Now it is going to reveal the car back into view because that is what was being removed with the generative fill layer, but we can easily go and refine this using a couple of different tools. So now with this complete, I'm going to leave this selection active and then touch up the outside edge of this leg using the remove tool. So once again, going to the remove tool layer, I'm going to select the remove tool by pressing J and then with the sample all layers enabled, remove after each brush stroke disabled, I'll click and drag over this part of the car like so, and I'll only be able to select outside of the edge of my subject's leg because of this active selection. I'll press enter to commit to those changes and Photoshop will automatically remove that for me. Now for this remaining area between my subject's legs, I'll press command or control D to deselect this and we'll just use another generative fill layer to make our life nice and easy. With the lasso tool selected by pressing L, I'll just create a much smaller and specific selection area around my subject's leg so that Photoshop has an easier time to only remove the things that we don't want and it won't really mess up the edges of his pants that we do want to maintain. So with this selection active, we'll click on generative fill just like before. We'll then click on generate with no specific prompt added to that generative fill adjustment. Once again, we have a few different variations that we can choose between but the first one seems to be my favorite. So I'll just click on that variation to enable it. Now zooming out, you can see that we have successfully removed the car from the photo, the cars in the background, the people from the sidewalk and we have maintained the look of our subject. So looking at our before and after, it's pretty crazy how much we were able to remove with relatively little effort all because of the help of generative fill. This is by far one of my favorite new object removal adjustment options and it is something that you should definitely use when you're trying to remove larger things from your images.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Welcome to the Photoshop in 5 series, where today, in less than 5 minutes, I'll teach you how to remove unwanted subjects or objects from your photos in 3 simple steps. Selection, removal and touch up. First, we're going to start with some easy to use selection methods. That way, no matter the job, you're always going to have a method to remove your subjects. The first is the quick selection tool, or W. Simply select around the subject or object you want to remove, and Photoshop will select what is inside. This works best with space around it. Second is the lasso tool, or L. This is good if you have a steady hand and for smaller or simple subjects, simply draw around them. If you need to move the canvas whilst you're doing this, hold down left click and hold spacebar at the same time to move the canvas. The polygonal lasso tool, or L, works the same, but with straight lines you click between, and is a little more forgiving if your path is not quite right. You can also hold spacebar to move the canvas. Third, we have the quick mask mode. Hit this button to activate it, then select the paintbrush or hit B. Everything will be painted transparent red, and this shows what we are selecting. Make sure that the hardness is 100, opacity is 100 and flow is 100. You can find these settings in the option bar located at the top of the screen. To adjust your brush size, hold alt, right click and slide left or right to change it. You can also go up to the options panel to change it as well. Now you can paint over your subject. Remember we are making sure, if possible, to leave a little bit of space. When you are finished, hit the quick mask mode button again and your painting will become a selection. We want to invert our selection, so simply press shift, control and I at the same time, and our selection is ready to go. The final method is the pen tool, or P. Simply click to drop a point. When you drop another point, the two will connect. You can hold and drag on your new point to make the line curved. Hold the alt button and press on the middle of the curved point if you want to continue with a straight line instead for your next point. If you don't, the line will continue in its natural curve when you make your next point. This tool has so many options and cool features, so be sure to check out one of Photoshop's other amazing tutorials to learn even more about the pen tool. Once finished, go to paths, control click the path in the box and your path will become a selection. Now I'll show you how to expand the selection for those methods that don't leave space around the selection. You can simply go to select, modify, expand. The number will depend on how big your image is. 15 should work well for this image and your selection now has some room to make filling it even smoother. Now let me show you where the magic happens with the content aware fill tool. For the automatic option, hit control backspace to bring up the fill panel. Set the contents to content aware fill. Make sure colour adaptation is ticked and hit ok to let Photoshop do its magic. How incredible is that result? If our subject is a little bit more complex or the background is a little bit more difficult, we can actually manually select the data we want to fill with. Go edit, content aware fill. Here you can choose what data is used to remove subjects. We can change the opacity of our selection here and the colour if it clashes with our image so I'm going to choose red. Keep all these other settings as is for now. This preview window will show you how the fill will look with the info you have given it. This is looking great. If I wanted to remove some of the selection or add to it, I simply select the brushes at the top and hold alt and right click as you slide your mouse to change the size of your brush. I'm going to remove everything except the beach around this young girl to make sure it doesn't sample from it. My preview looks great so I'm going to hit ok. Again, perfectly blends the image to remove the subject. For our final step, let me show you how to touch up your removals so that they're always seamless. Let's follow this process again with a more complex removal of this blanket that touches our other subject who is the main focus. Again, we remove anything we don't want to sample from, so anything that isn't the backdrop must be removed. Then we hit ok. Highlight both layers, ctrl j to duplicate them, then ctrl e to merge them. Let's choose the clone stamp tool. And now we're going to set the flow to less than 5 and a low opacity to help us blend. Here we hold alt and click to choose our reference point. Then wherever we next click, hold and paint, we'll paint from our reference point, the little plus, so we can blend. Did you see that? I went too wide and my plus started referencing my subject to paint with. To avoid this from happening, make smaller brush strokes and take your time. I slowly painted the center and worked my way out until I had a gradient I was happy with. Constantly using the alt click to get a new reference point, trying to always focus on a natural blend, setting my flow low to help me do this. Now you have touched up the removal and look how seamless it is with this beautiful photo.

It's so good to have you here and see all of your smiling faces. We're talking about contentaware fill today. How to remove anything from Photoshop, but there's a new way to do it. It's not, like, brand brand brand new, but the software, the engine, the brain, the magic behind contentaware fill has advanced to something that is even more incredible. It's way more usable, and now it makes it even easier to get anything out of your photos. Not just removing people from landscapes. We're talking removing cars, signs, buildings, clouds, like, everything. Removing everything from your photos. I'm not even going to say anything more about it. I'm going to jump right in and show you how great it is, but first, I'm going to show you how the old one works, because then it'll make more sense for how the new one's better, and just watch. Okay, so once you have Photoshop open, let's say right now you've got this photo of the Ford Raptor. Not sponsored. I wish it was. Ford, if you want to give me a Raptor, I'll gladly take it. Let's say you've got this door that's just peeking out the side of this frame. It's a pretty good frame. I like this shot, but I don't want the door there. So, what are our options? Well, first of all, what you could do is come over here, hit S, and you can start clone stamping the door out, but that's not going to look as good, because as you guys know, when you clone stamp a lot like I'm doing right now, you can kind of, when you zoom out, you can kind of see a stamped area. It's kind of like a dead giveaway, unless you're like a master at it. I am not. So, you would revert to contentaware fill by hitting L, selecting the lasso, lasso, lasso, lasso, whatever, and what you're going to do is highlight the entire door just by coming down the side. Okay, once that's done, you would hit Shift Delete, hit OK, and contentaware fill would do its job. Now, let's zoom in and move over here so you can see this. You see that dirty taillight and like a half rim and a piece of attire that's stamped into the sand? Most of the door is gone, yes, but we've still got this problem area, and that is inherently the problem sometimes that you run into using contentaware fill in Photoshop. So, what contentaware fill is doing is it's scanning that image and it's finding an area that's like that to replace it with so sometimes it gets confused and it stamps areas from other parts of the photos into what you're trying to delete, which gives you this kind of floating taillight. Sometimes it's spot on, like if you're doing something small in a big sky and you just want to get rid of a couple birds, it's got lots of areas to sample from. There's lots of space around those birds. You can delete them out, boop, it fills it in no problem, but because there's not a lot of space here between the raptor and the side of the frame, it's sampling from a very small area. That's why we're getting that taillight stamped over where we don't want it. This is where the new features of contentaware fill come in, because now we're able to choose the area that we want Photoshop to sample, which makes all the difference. I'm sorry, my phone's ringing here, it's driving me nuts. Peter McKinnon speaking. Oh, yeah, I was in the middle of a... It's Squarespace. No, I wasn't talking to you, I was just... Yes, yes, I heard, I read all the updates. It's great. Yeah, we went through the list. Great customer service. They have great customer service. Yeah, yeah, 247. Yeah, I know, you guys are amazing at hitting people back. No, you really are. No, I'm talking to you, I'm sorry. You've got my full attention, man. It's great to hear from you. Yeah, yeah, all in one platform. Yeah, everything's there, everything's ready to go. You don't need to be a web designer. I remember telling my audience all about that, how it's super easy, it's super easy to make websites. Like five minutes if you're slow. Yeah, you guys have beautiful designer templates. No, they actually have like legit templates, like they're not garbage at all. No, they look good. Yeah, my site right now is Squa... Yeah, I'm using one of them. Now I'm back, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, super easy to set up and transfer your domain. Breeze, yeah, I remember I did all that myself. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Okay, so that's cool, like you can sell stuff now with an online store. Yeah. No, I'm talking... Why does it sound like I'm talking to the camera? No, I'm not, I'm not making... That's cool, though, that you can sell stuff now, that's actually really exciting. Like we could sell ourselves now online, like not our... We could sell our products, not ourselves. Yeah, no. Very cool. Very cool. Yeah, business related, personal, for fun, hobby, whatever. Yeah, it's great, it's diverse. I'll let them know, yeah. Just like before, right? In the description, I'll put the link in, squarespace.com slash mckinnon and then use code mckinnon at checkout and they'll save. It was 10? 10. Amazing. Yeah, I'll let them know for sure. I know it sounds like I'm making a video, I'm not, I promise. No, this is good. We're having a private call. Okay, so great to hear from you. Thanks so much. Okay, yes. Squarespace. Love Squarespace. With Squarespace, you can... What you're gonna do now, instead of hitting shift delete to activate content aware, you're gonna go up and hit the edit button. So, do the same thing by hitting L on your keyboard, select the door of the object, whatever you want to remove, in this case, it's the door of the other truck. Once it's selected and you see those marching ants, you're gonna go up, edit, you're gonna come down and hit content aware fill. That's gonna open a new tool window which you can see here where we have our masked area in green, we have a preview on the right side. Coming back over to the left side, everything that's in green is where the software is taking from to sample, to replace what we're trying to delete right now. So, it's taking from this whole truck. So, what we want to do is use the eraser tool that's already selected and we want to erase out the truck because we don't want that taillight. So, we're trying to tell Photoshop by removing this truck, don't use this part of the photo to sample out. We don't want to use this. We want to use the desert and the sky to create more desert and sky. We don't want to use the truck to create desert and sky. So, we're removing it to say no, we don't want this selected. I'm gonna paint away this entire truck. So, now, watch this. When I let go, it's gonna resample not using anything from the truck and we can see on our preview on the right, instantly that taillight is gone because it's not taking anything from the truck. So, now we have as you can see, a really clear, clean deletion of that door. We can output to a new layer, hit okay and you can see over here the background copy. I can just hide that and unhide that and that is a super super clean removal of something in a photo using that new content aware via the edit button. Very excited on that. And that's it guys. That's all I wanted to share with you for this video because that is a tool that I use on a daily basis. I use content aware a lot in my photos but when this new kind of, this new tool kit opened up, we were actually able to select what we wanted Photoshop to sample from. That opened up so many doors and made life easier for a lot of people because half the battle was just then cleaning up what content aware fill didn't do right. Now, it's on you and you're doing it right. So, guys, I hope you use that. I hope you get something out of it. Hit the like button if you like this video. Give me some comments below if you have any other tips using content aware fill or we can teach each other some new tricks as well. If you're doing something or you've already been using this, that's amazing. Kudos to you. I'm super excited about it. Thanks again. Subscribe if you aren't already. Assault. Assault the like button. Ring the bell and all those very dramatic things that YouTubers say at the end of videos. Very much appreciate you guys watching. Thanks so much and I will see you on Thursday. Got my hat back. Oh, I hit the mic. I totally hit the mic. Look, it's in the frame now. I really have all the things. Like, I just suck at that so badly. It's a tight little spot around the monitor and the light and the mic and you gotta do it. You gotta do it like that. It's still weird. I'm losing it. I'm losing it. Okay.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```This new magical removal tool is absolutely insane to say the least. You have already used the Spot Healing Brush Tool for decades, right? And to remove anything with the Spot Healing Brush Tool, you know what to do. Let us say we want to remove this table. We simply paint over it. You want to make sure everything is properly covered and this is the result you get. As you can see, there's a lot of breakpoints, a lot of artifacts here. So, that's the result with the Spot Healing Brush Tool. Let's save that as a snapshot. So, we just opened up History and we click on this button to create a snapshot. This is the Spot Healing. Wait for it. One of the more recently introduced tools that we use time and again is the ContentAware Fill. Let's try that as well. Let's use the Polygonal Lasso Tool and make a selection around the table. And now, let's go to Edit ContentAware Fill. Let's keep it at defaults for now and hit OK. So, that is the result we get. Ctrl or Command D, by the way, to deselect. That's the result for the ContentAware Fill. Let's save it as a history state as well. Let's go to History, click on this button, ContentAware Fill. Now, it is time for us to test the new tool. Sorry for the wait. First of all, let's get back to how it was by clicking on the first one in History. This is our original image. You will find this new tool, the Remove Tool inside of the Healing group. So, click and hold and here is the magical tool. Let us select that. And similarly, all you have to do is just paint. Let's see what it does. There you go. That is just insanely amazing. Now, there's a problem right here. Very slight problem. However, if you just paint here, even that is fixed. Let's paint one more time. Fixed. This is just on a crazy level. Let us compare. Let's save it as a history state as well. This is the Remove Tool. So, here you have the Spot Healing, ContentAware and the Remove Tool. This is crazy on very many levels. Now, before you run to test this feature, know this feature is only available in the beta version of Photoshop. You can get the public beta. Here's how to do it. So, all you need to do is to open your Creative Cloud application, go to Beta Apps section and right next to Photoshop Beta, click on the Install button. Once you have installed it like I have, you will see the Open button. Now, do know that if you're using the Captain Jack Sparrow version of Photoshop, you might not be able to have access to this feature. Let's push it a little bit. Can we remove this swatch? Let's try that. Simply paint over it. Let's see. Oh my gosh! It created that line perfectly and this is just insane. Now, these shadows should not be there. They came in because of the watch. So, I'm just going to paint over it and even that is fixed. Even the repair work after painting, let's say it didn't get an area right, it does it perfectly. And you don't have to even sample from any place. So, Meredith Stotzner from Adobe wrote about this feature, good friend of mine. And she says that fences or edges are seamlessly completed. By the way, I'll link up this article in the description. Let's see how true is that. We'll try to remove this subject and keep the fence intact. Let's also use this opportunity to learn about a few features. The first one is Sample All Layers. It gives you nondestructive abilities. Let us say you created a new layer and if this was unchecked and if you tried to paint, it won't do anything. It cannot do anything as this layer has nothing in it. But if you allow it to sample all the layers by checking this, it will not only sample all the layers but fill it only in that particular layer, making it absolutely nondestructive. So take a look, this is gone and this is perfectly gone. And the filled area is on a separate layer. The other feature right here is Remove After Each Stroke. When that is turned on, let's say I want to repair this area, I paint over it and when I let go, it just fixes that. When that is not turned on, it allows you to pick up the brush, continue painting and then apply it later. For example, I want to fix this and also I want this area to be painted. Let's say you need a couple brush strokes to do it perfectly and not let it do in every step of the way, just fully paint it. Once you're fully satisfied with the entire painting area, you click on this tick button and it will remove all of them together. And it still did a fantastic job. Now there are a couple of areas that it didn't get right. Don't worry about it. Repairing works fantastic with this tool. I'm going to check that back in. Paint. Gone. And you want to fix this? Just paint over it. Fixed. See how perfect that is. Now this area is looking odd. Paint it. Fixed. Similarly right here in these areas and it just works. So let us tell Photoshop to rethink this area. I'm going to paint a little more to give it a little more headroom. It's still not picking it. It's making it seamless. So let's start painting from right here so that it gets an idea. And now we paint again. And now we paint a little more and a little more and a little more right there. And there you go. Even that is taken care of. Something that would have been impossible early on. Rest of the areas are done. Let's click on the tick button right here. And even that is gone perfectly. Now this area looks weird and if you want to fix it, it works magically. So if you just paint over here, the line continues and that's the best part. The line doesn't continue here. Paint over there. Paint over there. It continues that line. And we're going to paint a little bit right over here as well. See, it straightens up all of these lines like magic. Now let's push it a little more to the extreme. So in this case, here we have our subject and here we have a net. Now we all know how to remove a net and that would be very easy to do because the net is so thin. However, let us say we wanted to remove the subject which is behind the net. Let's see if it does that. And if it does it perfectly, I'm going to stand up right here on my chair and clap. Let's see. Moment of truth. Let us apply it. Let's get ready. Well, it deserves a clap while I'm sitting. But it didn't do that perfectly. Still, it's incredible to say the least. Because have a look at the line. There's a slight bump. If we paint over it again, that will be fixed. Let's tick it for now. And let's check this box. Remove after each stroke for small repairs. So let's paint right over here as well. See, even that is fixed. Right here, these lines are weird. So let's paint over it. Let's see if Photoshop can fix that. Well, this is good. Now, it's not perfect. It creates a super thick line. But look at the technology. Let's paint right over here. Oh, it's good. It's okay. Better than nothing. There is room for improvement. But this is definitely a revolution. Now, let us talk about some drawbacks. Now, before we do, we have to understand that this is in beta. This is for you to test. Adobe is testing it and they have not finalized it. So maybe this will help them. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just being stupid. I don't know. Let's see. The first problem I see with this tool is that let's say I want to remove the painting without affecting the hat right there. Now, of course, I can make a selection by using the quick selection tool and make a selection of the outside. All right. And then I can use this tool right here, the remove tool, paint over the painting. It won't leak because of the selection. But even when we have made the selection, it will do something. Let's press Ctrl or Command D after it processes and have a look. It created this extension on the hat. And if you didn't make a selection and tried to carefully tread through, giving it a little bit of space, even then it will mess up. It won't get the hat perfectly right. There you go. You see these around the edge. So for those kind of complicated situations where two objects are attached together, you have to use something like the Content Aware Fill. Because if you're using the Content Aware Fill, it makes it super easy. Let's choose the Polygonal Lasso tool and make a selection of this painting. As easy as that. And then let's subtract the hat by simply using the Quick Selection tool. Hold the Alt key or the Option key to subtract. And it's perfectly subtracted. Then we will go to Edit, Content Aware Fill, and we'll tell Photoshop not to sample from the hat areas. So right now I know it looks crazy, like an abstract art. Let's subtract this area. We don't want it to sample from here. And there you go. This is a perfect one. Hit OK. Now there are a couple areas we need to fix, but take a look around the edge. This just works. So what do I feel about this? This is an incredibly revolutionary new feature. And this will definitely change Photoshop forever. Couple of things we have to fix. Number one, having the ability to work with it when two objects are attached. Number two, if we can have the same technology for Content Aware Fill, this will change the world. Or in other words, have a way to apply it in the form of a selection so that we don't have to set and fill through. I hope you enjoy playing with this feature. Let me know what you think in the comments. And if you have any ideas for improvements, let us know in the comments as well. Adobe reads that. Thank you so much for watching again. If this video helped you, make sure to give us a like and also don't forget to subscribe and not just subscribe, ring the bell so that you, my friend, don't miss any other future tips, tricks or tutorials. Special thanks to all of these nice, incredible, amazing people for helping keep PiXimperfect free for everybody forever. Thank you for your time. I'll see you in the next one. Until then, stay tuned and make sure that you keep creating.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hi there, this is Unmesh from PiXimperfect and today I'm going to share with you how to remove objects placed on complex perspectives in Photoshop. Take a look at this photo. We cannot just simply use the Clone Stamp tool right here. So, if you go ahead and create a brand new layer, use the Clone Stamp tool, take a sample from right here. All right, even if we try to match these lines, if we take it to the top, see, the lines are not matching up there. Why? Because they are following a perspective. We're going to have to use some special tools, some special features in Photoshop to be able to fix that. And that's what we're going to learn today. So without any further ado, let's get started. Before we begin, this video is sponsored by Wacom tablets. And you already know, I've been using one for years and years since I was a baby. Just kidding. If you are on your journey of mastering Photoshop, a graphic tablet is one of the best investments you can make because it gives you two things, precision and pressure sensitivity. And that's common to all graphic tablets. The one that I recommend is the Wacom Intuos Pro line. That's one of my favorites. I use the medium sized. So what happens is that it's not like a mouse, which is either switched on or switched off. There are levels of pressure and according to pressure, you can control a plethora of things. You can adjust the brush size, opacity, flow, scattering and take advantage of the features of some of the most advanced brushes in Photoshop. For example, if I go ahead and select the Kyle Ultimate Inking Thick and Thin, have a look, as I tilt the pen, the angle of the brush changes and that helps the brush to act very naturally. I don't know why I wrote Saturn, but you get the point. So if you want to check out the latest models of Wacom tablets and what I recommend, please check the links in the description. Back in the magical world of Photoshop, and if you want to go ahead and download this one and follow along, you already know what to do. Check the links in the description. Now the first thing is, remove the easy stuff. That's step one. So now we know that we can easily cover the top part of the plant with the wall and it's easy to do with the Clone Stamp tool. However, it would leak into the table and the chair. So we need to make a selection to limit that and the best way to do it is with the Pen tool. So press P for the Pen tool. Don't forget, the shortcut for the Pen tool is, it's right in the name, P. So let's start making a selection. So I'm going to start right in here, just to stay a little on the safer side. And if you want to learn how to use the Pen tool, go ahead and watch this guide. The more patient and accurate you are with the Pen tool, the better the result you're going to get. Now, to turn a curve into a corner, just hold the Alt key or the Option key, click on it and then it's now a corner. Click and drag to draw a curve. If you want to adjust anything, just hold the Ctrl or Command and then adjust these points. Now you can go ahead and select some extras and finish the loop. All right, once you have created the path, I would highly recommend to save it for later because who knows, maybe you might need it. So go to the Paths tab right here. If you cannot see it, go to Window and then make sure Paths is checked. Now just rename the work path to something, right, to just something, all right. Anytime you want to have access to it, all you got to do is to just select that and you have the access to it. You will never lose it. To turn this into a selection, what do you do? There are lots of ways. One of the ways is holding the Ctrl or Command and clicking on the thumbnail of the path. Now before applying the Clone Stamp tool, we cannot just directly apply the Clone Stamp tool and apply it right here because that will give a very sharp edge. We want some feathering on it, some softening on it. So what do you do? Go to Select, Modify and then Feather. Let's apply a feather of one or two pixels. One would be more than enough in this case. Now it might differ according to the resolution and you can do some trial and error to find out. Just do one stroke, see how it feels and it will clearly give you an indication whether you want to increase or decrease the feather. So with the Clone Stamp tool selected on a brand new layer, make sure you are in the Layers panel, just take a sample from above the plant and start painting right here. That's all you got to do. And we have that taken care of. Press Ctrl or Command D to deselect. And there you go. Have a look. The better the selection, the more patient you are with the Pen tool, the better results you're going to get. Now again, my friend, we need to take care of these leaves and we might need the selection again. But I accidentally pressed Ctrl or Command D and we might have even gone a couple steps into the future. We want the selection back. We don't want to undo stuff. So how do you get the selection back? And that's why I asked you to save the path. Just go to the Paths tab, hold the Ctrl or Command, click on the thumbnail to get it back. If you want to feather it, you can do that as well by going to Select, Modify and then Feather. Let's go for the same values and again select the Clone Stamp tool and then just fix that area as well. Hold the Alt or Option and then click to take a sample and fill over it. It's not filling. You know why? Because the selection is on the opposite side. Press Ctrl, Shift and I to invert the selection. Now hold the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample and fill on this side. Now we have a selection. It just won't go out. There you go. Press Ctrl or Command D once you're done and the top area is fixed. Step number two is defining the perspective. Before you start to remove this stuff right over here, we need to define what the perspective is. By the way, before moving to step number two, do not forget to keep things organized. Just name Layer 1 to anything. Anything that can help you remember what it was. So for me, it would be Removing the Easy Stuff. Now let's create a new layer on top of that and let's name this Perspective Removal. This is where we will define the perspective. Go to Filter and then Vanishing Point. Just zoom in and with the Create Plane tool, the shortcut to which is C, just mark along the four corners of the table. Now adjust these points and make sure they are positioned accurately. Now even though everything is so well aligned, there's still a gap right there. Because in the real world, my friend, things are just a little twisted, uneven or bent. Just like my right nostril is a little bigger than my left one or the vice versa. I don't really remember. But now that you have defined the perspective, everything you do inside it in this dialog box will maintain the perspective. For example, even if you try to paint with something, so let's say I'm painting with white, it maintains the perspective. The further we take it, the smaller it becomes. The closer we bring it, the larger it becomes. And it adjusts its shape according to the perspective. Let's go back by pressing Ctrl or Command Z. Now it's time for us to move to step number three, which some of you might have already guessed and that is Cloning in Perspective. If you have not noticed yet, there's also a Clone tool that you can work with in the perspective. And in here, if you try to clone, the lines will match up. Now in the Clone settings, there are some options. Diameter is simply the size of the brush. Hardness is simply the hardness of the brush. We want it to be absolutely soft. So we keep the hardness at zero. Opacity is the opacity of the brush. And this is an important one. Do you want to turn on the Healing or do you want to keep it off? So what does Healing do? To understand this, let's first learn what Healing does not do. So if you turn off Healing, now when you try to sample from a place by holding the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample, and then now you try to paint something right here, okay, it is just a simple copy paste with a brush. It doesn't change its texture, color or anything. It doesn't try to adjust, just like the Clone Stamp tool. It's a dumb tool that just copies and pastes in a brush. That's all there is to it. However, if you turn on the Healing, now when you try to take a sample, and now when you paint right over here, and when you release your mouse, it'll try to match up. It did a pretty bad job because we didn't cover everything, but it tries to match up. And sometimes dumb works better because then it's just straightforward and we have complete control over it. So in this case, we're just going to turn off Healing. We want it to be dumb so that we can control them. Now all you got to do is let's start from right here, hold the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample, and then let's start painting. Match up the lines, make sure everything is aligned, and then start painting. All right, this much is fine for now. Now I would suggest avoiding doing all at once. Doing bit by bit gives you more control over it and keeps the tone smoother. Take a sample from right here again, hold the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample, and then we will try to paint right over here. See we made the brush a little too big and it's also bringing up the edge of the path. Let's try it again. Make the brush a little smaller this time. Take a sample again and start painting. Make sure everything is aligned. It's okay. You don't have to do all at once. Do bit by bit. Otherwise, you will begin to see lines right over here. All right, it looks pretty much done. We can fix the top area later. Now let's do this area. Some areas are still a little dark. No problem. Let's take a sample from right here and this time we want to do a little bit of matching. So let's turn on Healing and try to cover over it. There you go. Let's leave it. It'll try to match it up and it has done a pretty good job. Press Ctrl or Command 0 to just fit the canvas to the screen and there you go. It's pretty much removed. Hit OK once you're satisfied. The problem is still not completely solved. Have a look. There is this area still left out. We need to fix that. It's simple. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool and let's make a selection of that area. To keep it smooth, just give it a little feather by going to Select and then Modify Feather. One pixel is fine. Hit OK and then with the help of the Clone Stamp tool, just take a sample by holding the Alt key or the Option key. Click to take a sample. Make sure Sample Current and Below is selected and then just paint. Easily fixed. Press Ctrl or Command D to deselect and there you go. That's how to remove objects placed on complex perspectives with Photoshop. Let's do a quick little recap. Step number one, remove the easy stuff with the help of the Clone Stamp tool or the Healing Brush tool, the Patch tool, whichever is your favorite. Step number two, define the perspective by going to Filter and then Vanishing Point. Just define the plane. Once you have defined it, just remove or clone in perspective by using the Clone Stamp tool right in there. And we learned Healing. What is Healing if you keep it turned off and turned on? If you keep it turned on, it'll try to match the cloned area with the surrounding areas. If you keep it turned off, it is just a simple copy and paste in a brush, just like the Clone Stamp tool. Step number four is simply finishing touches, removing little defects here and there. And that's all there is to it. So that's all for this video. I would like to take this moment to thank all these nice and amazing people for supporting PiXimperfect on Patreon and helping me keep PiXimperfect free for everybody forever. Thanks so much for watching. I'll see you in my next one. Till then, stay tuned and make sure that you keep creating.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```In this Photoshop tutorial, I'm going to show you how to remove anything from a photograph. Now, this could be from power lines to braces on teeth to people and more. Let's get started. Hey, Cafe crew, Colin Smith here from PhotoshopCAFE.com, and today, I'm going to show you several different techniques for removing things in photographs. We're going to get rid of braces on teeth, we're going to get rid of power lines and we're going to remove people. Now, there's going to be a number of different techniques in these tutorials, so pay attention to these techniques and also be flexible that you can use these to remove anything from a photograph. And by the way, if you're new to this channel, I do a new Photoshop tutorial every single week, so consider hitting the Subscribe button right now and also a lot of the tutorials that I do, there's also a written component on the PhotoshopCAFE website, and generally speaking, I'll put a link underneath where you can go in there and check that out, too. So let's get started with technique number one. In this case, I don't know if you've ever done any corporate work, but there's always somebody that leaves the company right after the photo's been taken for, say, the annual report, and in this case, this guy here is no longer with the company. We need to get rid of him. So what do we do? Do we schedule another shoot or do we get rid of him in Photoshop? Obviously, it's pretty simple. We're going to be getting rid of him in Photoshop. Spoiler alert. Okay, so this is how I'm going to do it. We're going to grab the Lasso Tool. First thing we want to do is just kind of create a clean area behind him, but let's start with a quick selection tool and we're just going to make a selection around our worker that is no longer at the company. Of course, this also works just as well for exes, you know, for those beautiful holiday photos that you want to keep the photo, but you don't want that person, same technique. All right, so we've selected him and what we want to do is we want to get rid of him, but before we do, I want to put on a new layer. All right, so we're going to duplicate the layer, so drag it in there and notice we've got a copy and I always like to have a nice clean copy behind. And what we want to do now is we want to get rid of our person, so we're just going to use ContentAware Fill, Shift Delete and that's Shift Backspace on Windows opens up the Fill dialog box. Now go and choose ContentAware. ContentAware is now active and we're just going to click OK and we'll see how it looks. All right, not a bad starting place. Well, maybe not. All right, so we've got some other ways we can do this. Let's go here and we're going to choose to Edit. We're going to go down to ContentAware Fill and what we can do is hit the Spacebar to move across and we want to remove these people from the selection, so it just shows the background. Make sure you grab this masking tool and then we're just going to paint over the people because we don't want them to be included in our sample. So it's just as simple as grabbing them and let's just paint over our other person. And then you can look in the Preview here and this will update and see how it's looking a lot cleaner now. Looks like I really want to go just a little bit wider with him, so why don't we grab our Lasso Tool here and what I can do is I can actually just go here and increase the area around him, so we want to just go around his head. Let's select all of that and notice how it updates in the Preview. Same thing down here. Let's go down there and we're going to select a larger area. Drawing a little wonky here but that's okay. And looking in here, see how that updates now and we can see we're doing a lot better. Let's make sure we just increase the area on the side there. That should update, looking good, looking good, maybe a little bit more. Notice how this is appearing and this is coming from the floor, so why don't we also go in there. I'm just going to hit the Spacebar and I'm going to grab in here. And by the way, what I did there is I just did Fit to Screen and this can just save a little bit of time because we don't want that panel at the bottom there. See, now that removes, it looks a lot better. There's a problem there but don't worry about that. So we're good. We're going to click OK to apply a ContentAware Fill, Ctrl D to deselect. All right, so we want to just kind of move these people over now. So what we're going to do is just select both of these layers and then we're going to hit Ctrl E and then what it's doing is it's essentially giving us one copy with the clean and one copy there. So what we're going to do now is we're going to select our people, so let's just grab our Lasso Tool and let's make a selection around them and make sure we go down over her area here nicely, select that bottom and now what we want to do is move them over and we're going to choose ContentAware Move. Now we're just going to click and drag over. I'm going to say overlapping her arm just a little bit there, maybe about there, release and then hit Enter to apply. Okay, so two things happened there. One, it blended this into the new area and then it used ContentAware Fill to clean up the area that we came out of and you can see it's not bad but there's a little bit of work that needs to be done there and, you know, for this last little bit, there's different ways we could do it. You know, we could just copy a selection or we could use the Clone Stamp Tool, maybe create a new layer, go in here, grab our Clone Stamp Tool and make sure Current and Below is set, Alt or Option key to kind of sample that floorboard, move over so we see it's lined up nicely, tap and now we just paint with the clean area. See that? And this area here with this couple of little artifacts, you can use a little ContentAware and a little Clone just to clean it up. So here's a shot from Las Vegas and you've seen this sign many times before but maybe you didn't realize all these power lines were there. Well, fortunately, I've got a great technique to get rid of these really quickly. What we're going to do is we're going to create a new layer, then we're going to go down and we're going to grab our Spot Healing Brush Tool. Now, make sure with the new layer selected, we turn on Sample All Layers. Now, just use the left bracket key to get that brush nice and small and all we're going to do is click once, release, now hold the Shift key, move to the very end of that power line, tap again, creates a straight line and it gets rid of the power lines. Let's do it again. Tap, release, hold Shift, click, power lines. Simple as that. Now, what you don't want to do though is hit the Shift key first and then click because then it creates that line across there as you can see. So make sure you tap, release, hit Shift, click. Once again, tap, release, hold Shift, click. And if you miss a bit, no big deal, just tap, release, Shift. I know I'm being very repetitive but it's really important that you remember that proper sequence otherwise you get that line drawn there and it's as simple as that to get rid of straight lines such as power lines out of photos. Alright, let's move on to our third technique. Let's look at how do we get rid of braces inside of a photograph. Hit Ctrl or Command 1 and that will bring you into 100 view which is the best view for doing most retouching. You want to be in nice and close but you also want to see the pixels nice and true. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to select the Brush Tool and whenever you do retouching, you want to create a new layer and then that means if we mess it up, we can always just mask it out. Alright, what we're going to do is we're just actually going to paint over here. Now we could use a Clone Stamp Tool or we could use Content Aware but that's going to give us kind of blotchy results. In this case, there's not a lot of detail in teeth, so one of the most accurate ways of doing it, believe it or not, is to just sample the colors and paint and I'll demonstrate. Hit the Alt or the Option key, tap once and you'll see we now sampled that color and then we can just paint it in. So see how we're doing that? Let's go from the top here and what we're doing is just simply painting in with the color of that tooth. Now, a couple of things here. Notice it's a little bit blotchy. What you want to do is go up here, make sure that the hardness is turned all the way down. You want a nice soft brush and in this case, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make the brush a little bit bigger. I'm going to hit the Alt or the Option key and now I'm going to just kind of paint in there. Now, if you want to blend it in, we could drop the Opacity down a little bit and tap the 2 key and this is how you kind of blend two sides in. Select that color and now start to paint with a 20 Opacity. Grab the other side and start to paint for 20 Opacity and notice how now we're able to just kind of start to blend these in nicely. And then, you would just do the same thing here. Let's make a small brush. I'm going to hit Alt or Option and then we're just going to sample. Now, make sure we turn our Opacity all the way back to 100, which is just tapping the 0 key. And now, we're just going to go in here and see what we're doing. We're just painting back in here now, just sampling these colors. And then, once again, drop your Opacity down to 20 and we're just going to grab the outside area and just start to blend that in. See that? Down here, grab 20, start to blend it in and eventually, you're going to nicely blend in those teeth. Okay, you can see there the technique's pretty simple. All you're going to do is repeat this for every single tooth and you're going to be done. All right, I'm really curious. Was there any new techniques you learned in this tutorial? If so, let us know in the comments underneath what you learned new in this tutorial and also let me know what you'd love to see in future tutorials.

    "role": "user",
    "content": "Contents:\n```Today, you'll learn how to remove objects in Photoshop with ease, even when you're working with complex photos. This technique is one that can work as a standalone method, but can be enhanced with the help of other object removal tools, as you'll learn later in the lesson. Now, we're going to cover a lot in this video, so if you want to make sure that all these techniques stick, be sure to download the free lesson cheat sheet for this video available in the description below. Now, in this example, we're going to remove this car from the background, some of the cars down the street, and then we're going to touch things up with a few additional tools to finalize the result. Now, typically, with object removal tools, something as large as this car would be extremely, extremely difficult to remove, because we don't have enough sample areas to rebuild what was behind this car. But now, with Generative Fill, we can easily create new pixels within this photo to replace whatever was behind this car, or at least make it look like we have replaced it. So, the first thing we need to do in this process is select the Lasso tool. To select the Lasso tool, just press L on your keyboard, or you can find it right here inside of the toolbar. The reason I'm choosing the Lasso tool is because it's really easy to create a general selection around the object that you're trying to replace with Generative Fill. From there, we have a couple important settings up in the Options bar. I'll set the feather to 10 pixels, and then make sure that AntiAliased is checked. Now, we can go and create a selection around the object that we want to remove, which, in this case, is the car. So, I'll go and click and drag around the entire car, just outside of the edge, and that also includes this bumper that is between this gentleman's legs here. So, I'm going to go all the way around, like so, just around the outside edges of the car, giving enough breathing room, so Photoshop can figure out what actually needs to fill in this selection area. With this active selection, we can just go and click on Generative Fill inside of the Contextual taskbar. If you don't see this, just go up to Window, and then down here to the Contextual taskbar to reveal it. So, going ahead and clicking on Generative Fill, we'll then go and click Generate without any specific prompt added. Photoshop will take a minute to load the results, and then it will give us three variations here inside of the Properties panel that we can click between to see which option we like the best. Now, this one looks pretty decent, but the post is in a weird area, so I don't really like how that turned out. I don't like the way this curb is looking here either, so we're actually going to regenerate a few different results for us because all three of these didn't really work out in our favor. So, again, I'll go ahead and click on Generate to create a new set of options for us to choose from. Now, as you can see, we have a new row of variations that we can click between to choose something that we like. In this case, this example actually looks pretty good to me, or even this one here is pretty acceptable as well. I think I'm going to opt for this particular one instead. I think it looks the most seamless overall rather than having to regenerate something else for the sake of example. So, now all of those adjustments were applied onto a new generative fill layer that if I turn this on and off, you can see the before and after. So, what has happened here is that it rebuilt our subject's pants that I don't really like, but we'll touch this up in just a moment. But most importantly, it did a great job to fill in all of this detail that was once behind the car. This would be nearly impossible to replicate with any of the previous object removal tools in Photoshop like the Clone Stamp tool or the Remove tool for example. This is like taking things to a totally new level. Now, before we go and touch up the problem areas, I'm also going to go and remove these cars from the background. So, once again, still with the Lasso tool selected, I'll just click and drag around those cars in the background that I want to remove with the same settings as before so that 10 pixel feather antialias is checked. Once again, I'll click on Generative Fill in the contextual taskbar, then click on Generate while that selection is active and Photoshop will take a minute to load and then fill in that active selection area with something new. Now, with that complete, we can click between our variations until we have something that we're happy with. In this case, the second variation looks best to me, so I'm going to select that one here and again, it's on its own generative fill layer. So, now with this complete, we have to go through and touch up any other smaller areas that we would like to remove as well as fix any problems that we have created within our generative fill layers, such as the top of our subject's leg, for example. Before we get to touching up the leg, we're going to go and remove some of the people in the background of this photo just to make it totally clean. But because these are relatively small areas of the photo, rather than having to use all the computing power and slow down your computer for generative fill, we can just use something like the Remove tool to touch this up. Clicking on the New Layer icon to create a new layer at the top of our layer stack. I'll call this layer to Remove tool. I'll now go ahead and select the Remove tool from the toolbar here and then make sure that Sample All Layers is enabled. From there, I can just go and paint over the subject that I would like to remove or the person in the background and then because I have remove after each brush stroke unchecked, I'm going to go and paint over the next person I want to remove from the background as well. With those two pink highlights added, I'll press Enter and now Photoshop will remove those from my photo super easily. If you want to learn more about the Remove tool specifically, you could check out this video right here where I dive deep into how to use that tool. So now the final thing we have to do is touch up our subject's leg because if I zoom in here, you can see how he kind of has like this bent thigh. It looks like he has a broken leg or something. So what we need to do is create a selection of the original leg to restore it and then we need to touch up the outer edges once again. It sounds a bit complicated, but I promise you it's super easy. So holding Alt or Option, I'll click on the eyeball icon beside my image layer so that now I'm only viewing that layer. With that particular image layer selected, I'm going to go and select the Object Selection tool up here in the toolbar. With the mode set to Lasso, I'm going to click and drag around the area that I want to restore which is my subject's leg. So just click and drag just around the outside edges of that leg like so and then it will snap to the edge of that object. Now with this selection active, I'm going to reenable all of my previous layers by clicking and dragging through the eyeball icons to make them visible once again. Now to restore the contents of this selection area, we need to remove it from our generative fill layer that is causing this problem. So clicking on the generative fill layer that is the one that is removing that car and creating the issue with the leg, I'll click on that layer mask while I have this active selection. I'll then grab my brush tool by pressing B and set my foreground color to black. Now with that generative fill layer mask selected, I can just go and paint inside of this selection area and it's going to restore that leg for me. Now, of course, I still have some areas outside of the selection that are showing through from this generative fill layer. So what we're going to do is invert this selection and then mask out these additional problem areas. So within the contextual taskbar, we can just click on the invert selection option and now we're selecting everything outside of our subject's leg. And with that generative fill layer mask still selected, my foreground color is still set to black, I can now go and just mask out any of those other problem areas around my subject's leg. Now it is going to reveal the car back into view because that is what was being removed with the generative fill layer, but we can easily go and refine this using a couple of different tools. So now with this complete, I'm going to leave this selection active and then touch up the outside edge of this leg using the remove tool. So once again, going to the remove tool layer, I'm going to select the remove tool by pressing J and then with the sample all layers enabled, remove after each brush stroke disabled, I'll click and drag over this part of the car like so, and I'll only be able to select outside of the edge of my subject's leg because of this active selection. I'll press enter to commit to those changes and Photoshop will automatically remove that for me. Now for this remaining area between my subject's legs, I'll press command or control D to deselect this and we'll just use another generative fill layer to make our life nice and easy. With the lasso tool selected by pressing L, I'll just create a much smaller and specific selection area around my subject's leg so that Photoshop has an easier time to only remove the things that we don't want and it won't really mess up the edges of his pants that we do want to maintain. So with this selection active, we'll click on generative fill just like before. We'll then click on generate with no specific prompt added to that generative fill adjustment. Once again, we have a few different variations that we can choose between but the first one seems to be my favorite. So I'll just click on that variation to enable it. Now zooming out, you can see that we have successfully removed the car from the photo, the cars in the background, the people from the sidewalk and we have maintained the look of our subject. So looking at our before and after, it's pretty crazy how much we were able to remove with relatively little effort all because of the help of generative fill. This is by far one of my favorite new object removal adjustment options and it is something that you should definitely use when you're trying to remove larger things from your images.

RESPONSE: {
  "goal": "The main purpose of the video is to teach viewers how to remove objects from images in Photoshop using the Generative Fill tool, even in complex photos.",
  "procedure": "The process begins by selecting the object to be removed using the Lasso tool with a feather setting. The Generative Fill tool is then used to generate new pixels to replace the object. Variations are reviewed and selected for the best result. Additional objects are removed using the same method, and smaller areas are touched up with the Remove tool. Finally, any remaining issues are corrected by restoring parts of the original image and refining edges.",
  "outcome": "The final outcome is a clean image with the unwanted objects removed seamlessly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Generative Fill tool in Photoshop."

    "content": "Contents:\n```Welcome to the Photoshop in 5 series, where today, in less than 5 minutes, I'll teach you how to remove unwanted subjects or objects from your photos in 3 simple steps. Selection, removal and touch up. First, we're going to start with some easy to use selection methods. That way, no matter the job, you're always going to have a method to remove your subjects. The first is the quick selection tool, or W. Simply select around the subject or object you want to remove, and Photoshop will select what is inside. This works best with space around it. Second is the lasso tool, or L. This is good if you have a steady hand and for smaller or simple subjects, simply draw around them. If you need to move the canvas whilst you're doing this, hold down left click and hold spacebar at the same time to move the canvas. The polygonal lasso tool, or L, works the same, but with straight lines you click between, and is a little more forgiving if your path is not quite right. You can also hold spacebar to move the canvas. Third, we have the quick mask mode. Hit this button to activate it, then select the paintbrush or hit B. Everything will be painted transparent red, and this shows what we are selecting. Make sure that the hardness is 100, opacity is 100 and flow is 100. You can find these settings in the option bar located at the top of the screen. To adjust your brush size, hold alt, right click and slide left or right to change it. You can also go up to the options panel to change it as well. Now you can paint over your subject. Remember we are making sure, if possible, to leave a little bit of space. When you are finished, hit the quick mask mode button again and your painting will become a selection. We want to invert our selection, so simply press shift, control and I at the same time, and our selection is ready to go. The final method is the pen tool, or P. Simply click to drop a point. When you drop another point, the two will connect. You can hold and drag on your new point to make the line curved. Hold the alt button and press on the middle of the curved point if you want to continue with a straight line instead for your next point. If you don't, the line will continue in its natural curve when you make your next point. This tool has so many options and cool features, so be sure to check out one of Photoshop's other amazing tutorials to learn even more about the pen tool. Once finished, go to paths, control click the path in the box and your path will become a selection. Now I'll show you how to expand the selection for those methods that don't leave space around the selection. You can simply go to select, modify, expand. The number will depend on how big your image is. 15 should work well for this image and your selection now has some room to make filling it even smoother. Now let me show you where the magic happens with the content aware fill tool. For the automatic option, hit control backspace to bring up the fill panel. Set the contents to content aware fill. Make sure colour adaptation is ticked and hit ok to let Photoshop do its magic. How incredible is that result? If our subject is a little bit more complex or the background is a little bit more difficult, we can actually manually select the data we want to fill with. Go edit, content aware fill. Here you can choose what data is used to remove subjects. We can change the opacity of our selection here and the colour if it clashes with our image so I'm going to choose red. Keep all these other settings as is for now. This preview window will show you how the fill will look with the info you have given it. This is looking great. If I wanted to remove some of the selection or add to it, I simply select the brushes at the top and hold alt and right click as you slide your mouse to change the size of your brush. I'm going to remove everything except the beach around this young girl to make sure it doesn't sample from it. My preview looks great so I'm going to hit ok. Again, perfectly blends the image to remove the subject. For our final step, let me show you how to touch up your removals so that they're always seamless. Let's follow this process again with a more complex removal of this blanket that touches our other subject who is the main focus. Again, we remove anything we don't want to sample from, so anything that isn't the backdrop must be removed. Then we hit ok. Highlight both layers, ctrl j to duplicate them, then ctrl e to merge them. Let's choose the clone stamp tool. And now we're going to set the flow to less than 5 and a low opacity to help us blend. Here we hold alt and click to choose our reference point. Then wherever we next click, hold and paint, we'll paint from our reference point, the little plus, so we can blend. Did you see that? I went too wide and my plus started referencing my subject to paint with. To avoid this from happening, make smaller brush strokes and take your time. I slowly painted the center and worked my way out until I had a gradient I was happy with. Constantly using the alt click to get a new reference point, trying to always focus on a natural blend, setting my flow low to help me do this. Now you have touched up the removal and look how seamless it is with this beautiful photo.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Sike. Double sike. You totally thought... I mean, that was funny. What's up, everybody? Peter McKinnon here. Welcome back to yet another Two Minute Tuesday. It's so good to have you here and see all of your smiling faces. We're talking about contentaware fill today. How to remove anything from Photoshop, but there's a new way to do it. It's not, like, brand brand brand new, but the software, the engine, the brain, the magic behind contentaware fill has advanced to something that is even more incredible. It's way more usable, and now it makes it even easier to get anything out of your photos. Not just removing people from landscapes. We're talking removing cars, signs, buildings, clouds, like, everything. Removing everything from your photos. I'm not even going to say anything more about it. I'm going to jump right in and show you how great it is, but first, I'm going to show you how the old one works, because then it'll make more sense for how the new one's better, and just watch. Okay, so once you have Photoshop open, let's say right now you've got this photo of the Ford Raptor. Not sponsored. I wish it was. Ford, if you want to give me a Raptor, I'll gladly take it. Let's say you've got this door that's just peeking out the side of this frame. It's a pretty good frame. I like this shot, but I don't want the door there. So, what are our options? Well, first of all, what you could do is come over here, hit S, and you can start clone stamping the door out, but that's not going to look as good, because as you guys know, when you clone stamp a lot like I'm doing right now, you can kind of, when you zoom out, you can kind of see a stamped area. It's kind of like a dead giveaway, unless you're like a master at it. I am not. So, you would revert to contentaware fill by hitting L, selecting the lasso, lasso, lasso, lasso, whatever, and what you're going to do is highlight the entire door just by coming down the side. Okay, once that's done, you would hit Shift Delete, hit OK, and contentaware fill would do its job. Now, let's zoom in and move over here so you can see this. You see that dirty taillight and like a half rim and a piece of attire that's stamped into the sand? Most of the door is gone, yes, but we've still got this problem area, and that is inherently the problem sometimes that you run into using contentaware fill in Photoshop. So, what contentaware fill is doing is it's scanning that image and it's finding an area that's like that to replace it with so sometimes it gets confused and it stamps areas from other parts of the photos into what you're trying to delete, which gives you this kind of floating taillight. Sometimes it's spot on, like if you're doing something small in a big sky and you just want to get rid of a couple birds, it's got lots of areas to sample from. There's lots of space around those birds. You can delete them out, boop, it fills it in no problem, but because there's not a lot of space here between the raptor and the side of the frame, it's sampling from a very small area. That's why we're getting that taillight stamped over where we don't want it. This is where the new features of contentaware fill come in, because now we're able to choose the area that we want Photoshop to sample, which makes all the difference. I'm sorry, my phone's ringing here, it's driving me nuts. Peter McKinnon speaking. Oh, yeah, I was in the middle of a... It's Squarespace. No, I wasn't talking to you, I was just... Yes, yes, I heard, I read all the updates. It's great. Yeah, we went through the list. Great customer service. They have great customer service. Yeah, yeah, 247. Yeah, I know, you guys are amazing at hitting people back. No, you really are. No, I'm talking to you, I'm sorry. You've got my full attention, man. It's great to hear from you. Yeah, yeah, all in one platform. Yeah, everything's there, everything's ready to go. You don't need to be a web designer. I remember telling my audience all about that, how it's super easy, it's super easy to make websites. Like five minutes if you're slow. Yeah, you guys have beautiful designer templates. No, they actually have like legit templates, like they're not garbage at all. No, they look good. Yeah, my site right now is Squa... Yeah, I'm using one of them. Now I'm back, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, super easy to set up and transfer your domain. Breeze, yeah, I remember I did all that myself. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Okay, so that's cool, like you can sell stuff now with an online store. Yeah. No, I'm talking... Why does it sound like I'm talking to the camera? No, I'm not, I'm not making... That's cool, though, that you can sell stuff now, that's actually really exciting. Like we could sell ourselves now online, like not our... We could sell our products, not ourselves. Yeah, no. Very cool. Very cool. Yeah, business related, personal, for fun, hobby, whatever. Yeah, it's great, it's diverse. I'll let them know, yeah. Just like before, right? In the description, I'll put the link in, squarespace.com slash mckinnon and then use code mckinnon at checkout and they'll save. It was 10? 10. Amazing. Yeah, I'll let them know for sure. I know it sounds like I'm making a video, I'm not, I promise. No, this is good. We're having a private call. Okay, so great to hear from you. Thanks so much. Okay, yes. Squarespace. Love Squarespace. With Squarespace, you can... What you're gonna do now, instead of hitting shift delete to activate content aware, you're gonna go up and hit the edit button. So, do the same thing by hitting L on your keyboard, select the door of the object, whatever you want to remove, in this case, it's the door of the other truck. Once it's selected and you see those marching ants, you're gonna go up, edit, you're gonna come down and hit content aware fill. That's gonna open a new tool window which you can see here where we have our masked area in green, we have a preview on the right side. Coming back over to the left side, everything that's in green is where the software is taking from to sample, to replace what we're trying to delete right now. So, it's taking from this whole truck. So, what we want to do is use the eraser tool that's already selected and we want to erase out the truck because we don't want that taillight. So, we're trying to tell Photoshop by removing this truck, don't use this part of the photo to sample out. We don't want to use this. We want to use the desert and the sky to create more desert and sky. We don't want to use the truck to create desert and sky. So, we're removing it to say no, we don't want this selected. I'm gonna paint away this entire truck. So, now, watch this. When I let go, it's gonna resample not using anything from the truck and we can see on our preview on the right, instantly that taillight is gone because it's not taking anything from the truck. So, now we have as you can see, a really clear, clean deletion of that door. We can output to a new layer, hit okay and you can see over here the background copy. I can just hide that and unhide that and that is a super super clean removal of something in a photo using that new content aware via the edit button. Very excited on that. And that's it guys. That's all I wanted to share with you for this video because that is a tool that I use on a daily basis. I use content aware a lot in my photos but when this new kind of, this new tool kit opened up, we were actually able to select what we wanted Photoshop to sample from. That opened up so many doors and made life easier for a lot of people because half the battle was just then cleaning up what content aware fill didn't do right. Now, it's on you and you're doing it right. So, guys, I hope you use that. I hope you get something out of it. Hit the like button if you like this video. Give me some comments below if you have any other tips using content aware fill or we can teach each other some new tricks as well. If you're doing something or you've already been using this, that's amazing. Kudos to you. I'm super excited about it. Thanks again. Subscribe if you aren't already. Assault. Assault the like button. Ring the bell and all those very dramatic things that YouTubers say at the end of videos. Very much appreciate you guys watching. Thanks so much and I will see you on Thursday. Got my hat back. Oh, I hit the mic. I totally hit the mic. Look, it's in the frame now. I really have all the things. Like, I just suck at that so badly. It's a tight little spot around the monitor and the light and the mic and you gotta do it. You gotta do it like that. It's still weird. I'm losing it. I'm losing it. Okay.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```This new magical removal tool is absolutely insane to say the least. You have already used the Spot Healing Brush Tool for decades, right? And to remove anything with the Spot Healing Brush Tool, you know what to do. Let us say we want to remove this table. We simply paint over it. You want to make sure everything is properly covered and this is the result you get. As you can see, there's a lot of breakpoints, a lot of artifacts here. So, that's the result with the Spot Healing Brush Tool. Let's save that as a snapshot. So, we just opened up History and we click on this button to create a snapshot. This is the Spot Healing. Wait for it. One of the more recently introduced tools that we use time and again is the ContentAware Fill. Let's try that as well. Let's use the Polygonal Lasso Tool and make a selection around the table. And now, let's go to Edit ContentAware Fill. Let's keep it at defaults for now and hit OK. So, that is the result we get. Ctrl or Command D, by the way, to deselect. That's the result for the ContentAware Fill. Let's save it as a history state as well. Let's go to History, click on this button, ContentAware Fill. Now, it is time for us to test the new tool. Sorry for the wait. First of all, let's get back to how it was by clicking on the first one in History. This is our original image. You will find this new tool, the Remove Tool inside of the Healing group. So, click and hold and here is the magical tool. Let us select that. And similarly, all you have to do is just paint. Let's see what it does. There you go. That is just insanely amazing. Now, there's a problem right here. Very slight problem. However, if you just paint here, even that is fixed. Let's paint one more time. Fixed. This is just on a crazy level. Let us compare. Let's save it as a history state as well. This is the Remove Tool. So, here you have the Spot Healing, ContentAware and the Remove Tool. This is crazy on very many levels. Now, before you run to test this feature, know this feature is only available in the beta version of Photoshop. You can get the public beta. Here's how to do it. So, all you need to do is to open your Creative Cloud application, go to Beta Apps section and right next to Photoshop Beta, click on the Install button. Once you have installed it like I have, you will see the Open button. Now, do know that if you're using the Captain Jack Sparrow version of Photoshop, you might not be able to have access to this feature. Let's push it a little bit. Can we remove this swatch? Let's try that. Simply paint over it. Let's see. Oh my gosh! It created that line perfectly and this is just insane. Now, these shadows should not be there. They came in because of the watch. So, I'm just going to paint over it and even that is fixed. Even the repair work after painting, let's say it didn't get an area right, it does it perfectly. And you don't have to even sample from any place. So, Meredith Stotzner from Adobe wrote about this feature, good friend of mine. And she says that fences or edges are seamlessly completed. By the way, I'll link up this article in the description. Let's see how true is that. We'll try to remove this subject and keep the fence intact. Let's also use this opportunity to learn about a few features. The first one is Sample All Layers. It gives you nondestructive abilities. Let us say you created a new layer and if this was unchecked and if you tried to paint, it won't do anything. It cannot do anything as this layer has nothing in it. But if you allow it to sample all the layers by checking this, it will not only sample all the layers but fill it only in that particular layer, making it absolutely nondestructive. So take a look, this is gone and this is perfectly gone. And the filled area is on a separate layer. The other feature right here is Remove After Each Stroke. When that is turned on, let's say I want to repair this area, I paint over it and when I let go, it just fixes that. When that is not turned on, it allows you to pick up the brush, continue painting and then apply it later. For example, I want to fix this and also I want this area to be painted. Let's say you need a couple brush strokes to do it perfectly and not let it do in every step of the way, just fully paint it. Once you're fully satisfied with the entire painting area, you click on this tick button and it will remove all of them together. And it still did a fantastic job. Now there are a couple of areas that it didn't get right. Don't worry about it. Repairing works fantastic with this tool. I'm going to check that back in. Paint. Gone. And you want to fix this? Just paint over it. Fixed. See how perfect that is. Now this area is looking odd. Paint it. Fixed. Similarly right here in these areas and it just works. So let us tell Photoshop to rethink this area. I'm going to paint a little more to give it a little more headroom. It's still not picking it. It's making it seamless. So let's start painting from right here so that it gets an idea. And now we paint again. And now we paint a little more and a little more and a little more right there. And there you go. Even that is taken care of. Something that would have been impossible early on. Rest of the areas are done. Let's click on the tick button right here. And even that is gone perfectly. Now this area looks weird and if you want to fix it, it works magically. So if you just paint over here, the line continues and that's the best part. The line doesn't continue here. Paint over there. Paint over there. It continues that line. And we're going to paint a little bit right over here as well. See, it straightens up all of these lines like magic. Now let's push it a little more to the extreme. So in this case, here we have our subject and here we have a net. Now we all know how to remove a net and that would be very easy to do because the net is so thin. However, let us say we wanted to remove the subject which is behind the net. Let's see if it does that. And if it does it perfectly, I'm going to stand up right here on my chair and clap. Let's see. Moment of truth. Let us apply it. Let's get ready. Well, it deserves a clap while I'm sitting. But it didn't do that perfectly. Still, it's incredible to say the least. Because have a look at the line. There's a slight bump. If we paint over it again, that will be fixed. Let's tick it for now. And let's check this box. Remove after each stroke for small repairs. So let's paint right over here as well. See, even that is fixed. Right here, these lines are weird. So let's paint over it. Let's see if Photoshop can fix that. Well, this is good. Now, it's not perfect. It creates a super thick line. But look at the technology. Let's paint right over here. Oh, it's good. It's okay. Better than nothing. There is room for improvement. But this is definitely a revolution. Now, let us talk about some drawbacks. Now, before we do, we have to understand that this is in beta. This is for you to test. Adobe is testing it and they have not finalized it. So maybe this will help them. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just being stupid. I don't know. Let's see. The first problem I see with this tool is that let's say I want to remove the painting without affecting the hat right there. Now, of course, I can make a selection by using the quick selection tool and make a selection of the outside. All right. And then I can use this tool right here, the remove tool, paint over the painting. It won't leak because of the selection. But even when we have made the selection, it will do something. Let's press Ctrl or Command D after it processes and have a look. It created this extension on the hat. And if you didn't make a selection and tried to carefully tread through, giving it a little bit of space, even then it will mess up. It won't get the hat perfectly right. There you go. You see these around the edge. So for those kind of complicated situations where two objects are attached together, you have to use something like the Content Aware Fill. Because if you're using the Content Aware Fill, it makes it super easy. Let's choose the Polygonal Lasso tool and make a selection of this painting. As easy as that. And then let's subtract the hat by simply using the Quick Selection tool. Hold the Alt key or the Option key to subtract. And it's perfectly subtracted. Then we will go to Edit, Content Aware Fill, and we'll tell Photoshop not to sample from the hat areas. So right now I know it looks crazy, like an abstract art. Let's subtract this area. We don't want it to sample from here. And there you go. This is a perfect one. Hit OK. Now there are a couple areas we need to fix, but take a look around the edge. This just works. So what do I feel about this? This is an incredibly revolutionary new feature. And this will definitely change Photoshop forever. Couple of things we have to fix. Number one, having the ability to work with it when two objects are attached. Number two, if we can have the same technology for Content Aware Fill, this will change the world. Or in other words, have a way to apply it in the form of a selection so that we don't have to set and fill through. I hope you enjoy playing with this feature. Let me know what you think in the comments. And if you have any ideas for improvements, let us know in the comments as well. Adobe reads that. Thank you so much for watching again. If this video helped you, make sure to give us a like and also don't forget to subscribe and not just subscribe, ring the bell so that you, my friend, don't miss any other future tips, tricks or tutorials. Special thanks to all of these nice, incredible, amazing people for helping keep PiXimperfect free for everybody forever. Thank you for your time. I'll see you in the next one. Until then, stay tuned and make sure that you keep creating.```"

RESPONSE: {
  "goal": "The main purpose of the video is to demonstrate how to remove objects from an image in Photoshop using various tools, including a new Remove Tool available in the beta version of Photoshop.",
  "procedure": "The video first demonstrates the use of the Spot Healing Brush Tool and Content-Aware Fill to remove objects, highlighting their limitations. It then introduces the new Remove Tool, showing how it can be used to paint over and remove objects more effectively. The video also covers features like 'Sample All Layers' and 'Remove After Each Stroke' for nondestructive editing and efficient object removal.",
  "outcome": "The final outcome is a demonstration of the new Remove Tool's ability to seamlessly remove objects from images, outperforming older methods like the Spot Healing Brush and Content-Aware Fill, although it still has some limitations in complex scenarios."

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hi there, this is Unmesh from PiXimperfect and today I'm going to share with you how to remove objects placed on complex perspectives in Photoshop. Take a look at this photo. We cannot just simply use the Clone Stamp tool right here. So, if you go ahead and create a brand new layer, use the Clone Stamp tool, take a sample from right here. All right, even if we try to match these lines, if we take it to the top, see, the lines are not matching up there. Why? Because they are following a perspective. We're going to have to use some special tools, some special features in Photoshop to be able to fix that. And that's what we're going to learn today. So without any further ado, let's get started. Before we begin, this video is sponsored by Wacom tablets. And you already know, I've been using one for years and years since I was a baby. Just kidding. If you are on your journey of mastering Photoshop, a graphic tablet is one of the best investments you can make because it gives you two things, precision and pressure sensitivity. And that's common to all graphic tablets. The one that I recommend is the Wacom Intuos Pro line. That's one of my favorites. I use the medium sized. So what happens is that it's not like a mouse, which is either switched on or switched off. There are levels of pressure and according to pressure, you can control a plethora of things. You can adjust the brush size, opacity, flow, scattering and take advantage of the features of some of the most advanced brushes in Photoshop. For example, if I go ahead and select the Kyle Ultimate Inking Thick and Thin, have a look, as I tilt the pen, the angle of the brush changes and that helps the brush to act very naturally. I don't know why I wrote Saturn, but you get the point. So if you want to check out the latest models of Wacom tablets and what I recommend, please check the links in the description. Back in the magical world of Photoshop, and if you want to go ahead and download this one and follow along, you already know what to do. Check the links in the description. Now the first thing is, remove the easy stuff. That's step one. So now we know that we can easily cover the top part of the plant with the wall and it's easy to do with the Clone Stamp tool. However, it would leak into the table and the chair. So we need to make a selection to limit that and the best way to do it is with the Pen tool. So press P for the Pen tool. Don't forget, the shortcut for the Pen tool is, it's right in the name, P. So let's start making a selection. So I'm going to start right in here, just to stay a little on the safer side. And if you want to learn how to use the Pen tool, go ahead and watch this guide. The more patient and accurate you are with the Pen tool, the better the result you're going to get. Now, to turn a curve into a corner, just hold the Alt key or the Option key, click on it and then it's now a corner. Click and drag to draw a curve. If you want to adjust anything, just hold the Ctrl or Command and then adjust these points. Now you can go ahead and select some extras and finish the loop. All right, once you have created the path, I would highly recommend to save it for later because who knows, maybe you might need it. So go to the Paths tab right here. If you cannot see it, go to Window and then make sure Paths is checked. Now just rename the work path to something, right, to just something, all right. Anytime you want to have access to it, all you got to do is to just select that and you have the access to it. You will never lose it. To turn this into a selection, what do you do? There are lots of ways. One of the ways is holding the Ctrl or Command and clicking on the thumbnail of the path. Now before applying the Clone Stamp tool, we cannot just directly apply the Clone Stamp tool and apply it right here because that will give a very sharp edge. We want some feathering on it, some softening on it. So what do you do? Go to Select, Modify and then Feather. Let's apply a feather of one or two pixels. One would be more than enough in this case. Now it might differ according to the resolution and you can do some trial and error to find out. Just do one stroke, see how it feels and it will clearly give you an indication whether you want to increase or decrease the feather. So with the Clone Stamp tool selected on a brand new layer, make sure you are in the Layers panel, just take a sample from above the plant and start painting right here. That's all you got to do. And we have that taken care of. Press Ctrl or Command D to deselect. And there you go. Have a look. The better the selection, the more patient you are with the Pen tool, the better results you're going to get. Now again, my friend, we need to take care of these leaves and we might need the selection again. But I accidentally pressed Ctrl or Command D and we might have even gone a couple steps into the future. We want the selection back. We don't want to undo stuff. So how do you get the selection back? And that's why I asked you to save the path. Just go to the Paths tab, hold the Ctrl or Command, click on the thumbnail to get it back. If you want to feather it, you can do that as well by going to Select, Modify and then Feather. Let's go for the same values and again select the Clone Stamp tool and then just fix that area as well. Hold the Alt or Option and then click to take a sample and fill over it. It's not filling. You know why? Because the selection is on the opposite side. Press Ctrl, Shift and I to invert the selection. Now hold the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample and fill on this side. Now we have a selection. It just won't go out. There you go. Press Ctrl or Command D once you're done and the top area is fixed. Step number two is defining the perspective. Before you start to remove this stuff right over here, we need to define what the perspective is. By the way, before moving to step number two, do not forget to keep things organized. Just name Layer 1 to anything. Anything that can help you remember what it was. So for me, it would be Removing the Easy Stuff. Now let's create a new layer on top of that and let's name this Perspective Removal. This is where we will define the perspective. Go to Filter and then Vanishing Point. Just zoom in and with the Create Plane tool, the shortcut to which is C, just mark along the four corners of the table. Now adjust these points and make sure they are positioned accurately. Now even though everything is so well aligned, there's still a gap right there. Because in the real world, my friend, things are just a little twisted, uneven or bent. Just like my right nostril is a little bigger than my left one or the vice versa. I don't really remember. But now that you have defined the perspective, everything you do inside it in this dialog box will maintain the perspective. For example, even if you try to paint with something, so let's say I'm painting with white, it maintains the perspective. The further we take it, the smaller it becomes. The closer we bring it, the larger it becomes. And it adjusts its shape according to the perspective. Let's go back by pressing Ctrl or Command Z. Now it's time for us to move to step number three, which some of you might have already guessed and that is Cloning in Perspective. If you have not noticed yet, there's also a Clone tool that you can work with in the perspective. And in here, if you try to clone, the lines will match up. Now in the Clone settings, there are some options. Diameter is simply the size of the brush. Hardness is simply the hardness of the brush. We want it to be absolutely soft. So we keep the hardness at zero. Opacity is the opacity of the brush. And this is an important one. Do you want to turn on the Healing or do you want to keep it off? So what does Healing do? To understand this, let's first learn what Healing does not do. So if you turn off Healing, now when you try to sample from a place by holding the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample, and then now you try to paint something right here, okay, it is just a simple copy paste with a brush. It doesn't change its texture, color or anything. It doesn't try to adjust, just like the Clone Stamp tool. It's a dumb tool that just copies and pastes in a brush. That's all there is to it. However, if you turn on the Healing, now when you try to take a sample, and now when you paint right over here, and when you release your mouse, it'll try to match up. It did a pretty bad job because we didn't cover everything, but it tries to match up. And sometimes dumb works better because then it's just straightforward and we have complete control over it. So in this case, we're just going to turn off Healing. We want it to be dumb so that we can control them. Now all you got to do is let's start from right here, hold the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample, and then let's start painting. Match up the lines, make sure everything is aligned, and then start painting. All right, this much is fine for now. Now I would suggest avoiding doing all at once. Doing bit by bit gives you more control over it and keeps the tone smoother. Take a sample from right here again, hold the Alt key or the Option key, click to take a sample, and then we will try to paint right over here. See we made the brush a little too big and it's also bringing up the edge of the path. Let's try it again. Make the brush a little smaller this time. Take a sample again and start painting. Make sure everything is aligned. It's okay. You don't have to do all at once. Do bit by bit. Otherwise, you will begin to see lines right over here. All right, it looks pretty much done. We can fix the top area later. Now let's do this area. Some areas are still a little dark. No problem. Let's take a sample from right here and this time we want to do a little bit of matching. So let's turn on Healing and try to cover over it. There you go. Let's leave it. It'll try to match it up and it has done a pretty good job. Press Ctrl or Command 0 to just fit the canvas to the screen and there you go. It's pretty much removed. Hit OK once you're satisfied. The problem is still not completely solved. Have a look. There is this area still left out. We need to fix that. It's simple. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool and let's make a selection of that area. To keep it smooth, just give it a little feather by going to Select and then Modify Feather. One pixel is fine. Hit OK and then with the help of the Clone Stamp tool, just take a sample by holding the Alt key or the Option key. Click to take a sample. Make sure Sample Current and Below is selected and then just paint. Easily fixed. Press Ctrl or Command D to deselect and there you go. That's how to remove objects placed on complex perspectives with Photoshop. Let's do a quick little recap. Step number one, remove the easy stuff with the help of the Clone Stamp tool or the Healing Brush tool, the Patch tool, whichever is your favorite. Step number two, define the perspective by going to Filter and then Vanishing Point. Just define the plane. Once you have defined it, just remove or clone in perspective by using the Clone Stamp tool right in there. And we learned Healing. What is Healing if you keep it turned off and turned on? If you keep it turned on, it'll try to match the cloned area with the surrounding areas. If you keep it turned off, it is just a simple copy and paste in a brush, just like the Clone Stamp tool. Step number four is simply finishing touches, removing little defects here and there. And that's all there is to it. So that's all for this video. I would like to take this moment to thank all these nice and amazing people for supporting PiXimperfect on Patreon and helping me keep PiXimperfect free for everybody forever. Thanks so much for watching. I'll see you in my next one. Till then, stay tuned and make sure that you keep creating.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```In this Photoshop tutorial, I'm going to show you how to remove anything from a photograph. Now, this could be from power lines to braces on teeth to people and more. Let's get started. Hey, Cafe crew, Colin Smith here from PhotoshopCAFE.com, and today, I'm going to show you several different techniques for removing things in photographs. We're going to get rid of braces on teeth, we're going to get rid of power lines and we're going to remove people. Now, there's going to be a number of different techniques in these tutorials, so pay attention to these techniques and also be flexible that you can use these to remove anything from a photograph. And by the way, if you're new to this channel, I do a new Photoshop tutorial every single week, so consider hitting the Subscribe button right now and also a lot of the tutorials that I do, there's also a written component on the PhotoshopCAFE website, and generally speaking, I'll put a link underneath where you can go in there and check that out, too. So let's get started with technique number one. In this case, I don't know if you've ever done any corporate work, but there's always somebody that leaves the company right after the photo's been taken for, say, the annual report, and in this case, this guy here is no longer with the company. We need to get rid of him. So what do we do? Do we schedule another shoot or do we get rid of him in Photoshop? Obviously, it's pretty simple. We're going to be getting rid of him in Photoshop. Spoiler alert. Okay, so this is how I'm going to do it. We're going to grab the Lasso Tool. First thing we want to do is just kind of create a clean area behind him, but let's start with a quick selection tool and we're just going to make a selection around our worker that is no longer at the company. Of course, this also works just as well for exes, you know, for those beautiful holiday photos that you want to keep the photo, but you don't want that person, same technique. All right, so we've selected him and what we want to do is we want to get rid of him, but before we do, I want to put on a new layer. All right, so we're going to duplicate the layer, so drag it in there and notice we've got a copy and I always like to have a nice clean copy behind. And what we want to do now is we want to get rid of our person, so we're just going to use ContentAware Fill, Shift Delete and that's Shift Backspace on Windows opens up the Fill dialog box. Now go and choose ContentAware. ContentAware is now active and we're just going to click OK and we'll see how it looks. All right, not a bad starting place. Well, maybe not. All right, so we've got some other ways we can do this. Let's go here and we're going to choose to Edit. We're going to go down to ContentAware Fill and what we can do is hit the Spacebar to move across and we want to remove these people from the selection, so it just shows the background. Make sure you grab this masking tool and then we're just going to paint over the people because we don't want them to be included in our sample. So it's just as simple as grabbing them and let's just paint over our other person. And then you can look in the Preview here and this will update and see how it's looking a lot cleaner now. Looks like I really want to go just a little bit wider with him, so why don't we grab our Lasso Tool here and what I can do is I can actually just go here and increase the area around him, so we want to just go around his head. Let's select all of that and notice how it updates in the Preview. Same thing down here. Let's go down there and we're going to select a larger area. Drawing a little wonky here but that's okay. And looking in here, see how that updates now and we can see we're doing a lot better. Let's make sure we just increase the area on the side there. That should update, looking good, looking good, maybe a little bit more. Notice how this is appearing and this is coming from the floor, so why don't we also go in there. I'm just going to hit the Spacebar and I'm going to grab in here. And by the way, what I did there is I just did Fit to Screen and this can just save a little bit of time because we don't want that panel at the bottom there. See, now that removes, it looks a lot better. There's a problem there but don't worry about that. So we're good. We're going to click OK to apply a ContentAware Fill, Ctrl D to deselect. All right, so we want to just kind of move these people over now. So what we're going to do is just select both of these layers and then we're going to hit Ctrl E and then what it's doing is it's essentially giving us one copy with the clean and one copy there. So what we're going to do now is we're going to select our people, so let's just grab our Lasso Tool and let's make a selection around them and make sure we go down over her area here nicely, select that bottom and now what we want to do is move them over and we're going to choose ContentAware Move. Now we're just going to click and drag over. I'm going to say overlapping her arm just a little bit there, maybe about there, release and then hit Enter to apply. Okay, so two things happened there. One, it blended this into the new area and then it used ContentAware Fill to clean up the area that we came out of and you can see it's not bad but there's a little bit of work that needs to be done there and, you know, for this last little bit, there's different ways we could do it. You know, we could just copy a selection or we could use the Clone Stamp Tool, maybe create a new layer, go in here, grab our Clone Stamp Tool and make sure Current and Below is set, Alt or Option key to kind of sample that floorboard, move over so we see it's lined up nicely, tap and now we just paint with the clean area. See that? And this area here with this couple of little artifacts, you can use a little ContentAware and a little Clone just to clean it up. So here's a shot from Las Vegas and you've seen this sign many times before but maybe you didn't realize all these power lines were there. Well, fortunately, I've got a great technique to get rid of these really quickly. What we're going to do is we're going to create a new layer, then we're going to go down and we're going to grab our Spot Healing Brush Tool. Now, make sure with the new layer selected, we turn on Sample All Layers. Now, just use the left bracket key to get that brush nice and small and all we're going to do is click once, release, now hold the Shift key, move to the very end of that power line, tap again, creates a straight line and it gets rid of the power lines. Let's do it again. Tap, release, hold Shift, click, power lines. Simple as that. Now, what you don't want to do though is hit the Shift key first and then click because then it creates that line across there as you can see. So make sure you tap, release, hit Shift, click. Once again, tap, release, hold Shift, click. And if you miss a bit, no big deal, just tap, release, Shift. I know I'm being very repetitive but it's really important that you remember that proper sequence otherwise you get that line drawn there and it's as simple as that to get rid of straight lines such as power lines out of photos. Alright, let's move on to our third technique. Let's look at how do we get rid of braces inside of a photograph. Hit Ctrl or Command 1 and that will bring you into 100 view which is the best view for doing most retouching. You want to be in nice and close but you also want to see the pixels nice and true. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to select the Brush Tool and whenever you do retouching, you want to create a new layer and then that means if we mess it up, we can always just mask it out. Alright, what we're going to do is we're just actually going to paint over here. Now we could use a Clone Stamp Tool or we could use Content Aware but that's going to give us kind of blotchy results. In this case, there's not a lot of detail in teeth, so one of the most accurate ways of doing it, believe it or not, is to just sample the colors and paint and I'll demonstrate. Hit the Alt or the Option key, tap once and you'll see we now sampled that color and then we can just paint it in. So see how we're doing that? Let's go from the top here and what we're doing is just simply painting in with the color of that tooth. Now, a couple of things here. Notice it's a little bit blotchy. What you want to do is go up here, make sure that the hardness is turned all the way down. You want a nice soft brush and in this case, what I'm going to do is I'm going to make the brush a little bit bigger. I'm going to hit the Alt or the Option key and now I'm going to just kind of paint in there. Now, if you want to blend it in, we could drop the Opacity down a little bit and tap the 2 key and this is how you kind of blend two sides in. Select that color and now start to paint with a 20 Opacity. Grab the other side and start to paint for 20 Opacity and notice how now we're able to just kind of start to blend these in nicely. And then, you would just do the same thing here. Let's make a small brush. I'm going to hit Alt or Option and then we're just going to sample. Now, make sure we turn our Opacity all the way back to 100, which is just tapping the 0 key. And now, we're just going to go in here and see what we're doing. We're just painting back in here now, just sampling these colors. And then, once again, drop your Opacity down to 20 and we're just going to grab the outside area and just start to blend that in. See that? Down here, grab 20, start to blend it in and eventually, you're going to nicely blend in those teeth. Okay, you can see there the technique's pretty simple. All you're going to do is repeat this for every single tooth and you're going to be done. All right, I'm really curious. Was there any new techniques you learned in this tutorial? If so, let us know in the comments underneath what you learned new in this tutorial and also let me know what you'd love to see in future tutorials. Anyway, if you like this, smash the Like button into dust and also, if you're not part of the Cafe Crew yet, hit the Subscribe button right now and you'll get a new tutorial from me every single week. Ring the notification bell so you know when I upload it, which is every single Tuesday. Anyway, guys, thanks for watching and until next time, I'll see you at the Cafe. Bye.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hello and welcome. I'm James Murphy, and today we're talking about binary search. Binary search, also called bisection search, is an algorithm for finding an element quickly in a sorted array. Suppose we're trying to find 7 in this array. Is it in the left half or the right half? The right half. And then repeat. Finally, there's just one element left. That's our 7. Even though it's one of the first algorithms that one learns, it's also extremely important. Analyzing binary search is often the branching point for studying things like time complexities of algorithms and big O notation. Here you can see we started with 8 elements, and at each step we ruled out half of them. This idea of ruling out half of all the possibilities at each step is where binary search or bisection search gets its name. This is also where it gets its logarithmic time complexity from. So binary search is useful, fundamental, and simple. And yet, a huge percentage of programmers, even professional programmers, struggle to write binary search. How can the idea be so simple, but the implementation be so difficult? Well, it's not so difficult. You just have to think about it in the right way. The first thing we should decide on is, are we returning the object that we find, or the index that it was at? The index itself is a more useful piece of information. We can always just grab the object at that index later. But what do we do if the object we're looking for isn't there? Do we do something like return negative one, or maybe raise an exception? Or what if there are multiple valid indices to choose from? With every arbitrary choice that we make, we would have to remember the implementation details that go with that choice. A better way to do it is to rephrase the question so that there is always exactly one answer. So here's how I would rephrase the question. If I were going to add another seven into this sorted array, where should I put it so that it's the first seven? Notice that in this hypothetical, I'm always adding the seven into the array. That guarantees the array is nonempty and always contains at least one seven. But if it contains at least one seven, then there is always a unique first seven. The index of that first seven is the answer to my question. It doesn't matter whether or not the original array had a seven or multiple sevens in it. The location of the first seven in the new array is always uniquely determined. If there were no sevens, I would have to put it here to maintain the sorting property. And if there are already sevens, it would have to be the index of the first already existing one. Even if the array were empty, I still get a valid answer. In this case, I would have to insert the seven at index zero. Notice that zero is not a valid index into this array, but it still makes sense because the question that I asked was where should I insert it. And it certainly makes sense to insert it at index zero. The same applies for a nonempty array. Binary search might tell me that I have to put it at the end. As long as you keep in mind this interpretation of what binary search is supposed to return, it's much harder to get confused. I think that far too often binary search is taught solely as an algorithm that works on sorted arrays. But the array being sorted, I claim, is not actually the property that we're using here. Here, look, I changed some of the elements and this array is no longer in sorted order. But notice the steps are exactly the same. What we need is that everything less than seven is on the left and everything bigger than seven is on the right. In this array, the numbers have been replaced with the important information. Is this number less than seven? Notice how any trues are on the left and any falses are on the right. So now that we're looking at the relevant data, where do we insert seven so that it is the first seven? Notice that the answer that we're looking for is the index of the first false value, or the end of the array if there are no false values. This is the key insight that we need to keep in mind that makes the implementation extremely easy to remember. Squint your eyes and find the first false value. Okay, let's write the implementation. Low and high are lower and upper bounds on where this first false index is. Zero would mean the first value is false and length of the array would mean that all of the values are true, so we would need to put x at the end. The idea is that we are going to continually increase our lower bound and decrease our upper bound until they're equal. Low and high will meet at the unique index that we're looking for, so we could return either low or high. It makes no difference. We compute mid, which is the closest index to the middle between low and high. Python can represent arbitrarily large integers so we don't need to worry about overflow, but if you're doing this in another language besides Python you might have to worry about overflow. In that case you can represent the midpoint equivalently by writing it as low plus half the distance between low and high. If you write it this way it will never overflow. Next comes the part of the algorithm that is most often written incorrectly. We need to compare whatever's in the array at the midpoint with our given x and then update the lower or upper bound accordingly. Remember we're looking for the first false value where true or false is determined by asking the question, is this less than x? Well in this section the middle value is less than x. It is a true value. Since the value at mid is a true value the earliest a false value could occur is the next one, which is mid plus one. What about if we see a false value? In this case the first false value couldn't be any later than mid because there is a false value at mid, but it could be earlier. There might be other false values before the one that we've found. That means the best we can do is update our upper bound to be whatever mid is. And there you have it. This is a correct implementation. But how can we reason about it? How do we know that this actually gives the right answer? Well we know that low is always less than or equal to the correct answer is always less than or equal to high, and we do keep updating the lower and higher bounds, but how do we know that they actually meet so that the loop stops? It's enough to show that every iteration the difference between high and low always decreases by at least one. If we enter this clause the plus one ensures that low always increases by at least one. In this clause we're setting high to mid, so hopefully we're lowering high, but how do we know that mid was actually strictly less than high? Here we're actually using that integer division rounds down. Inside the while loop low is less than high, so low plus high is strictly less than high plus high. That means that when we divide by two and round down we'll get something strictly less than high. It's common to take low and high as optional parameters so that if you already have a lower or upper bound you can make use of that. And of course don't forget to check that the parameters are valid. And that's all there is to it. But wait, you ask, instead of returning the index to insert a 7 so that it would be the first 7, couldn't I also return the index so that it would be the last 7? Yeah, you could. You could follow essentially the same analysis and get a very similar algorithm. To find where it should go to be the first 7, the relevant piece of information is is it strictly less than 7. To find where it should go to be the last 7, you want to know is it less than or equal to 7. In either case the index that you're looking for is the first false value. You just need to decide on what you mean by true and false. The first one is called bisect left and the second bisect right. So this one that we already wrote is bisect left. Can you tell me what you need to change in order to make it bisect right? Here's an example of how you might use bisect left. For this function we want to find the index of the first x in the array or throw an error if there isn't one. Since we're looking for the first index we'll use bisect left. If there is already an x in the array, bisect left will return the index of the first one. So we would like to just check at that index and see if we see an x. If we don't get back a valid index or if we find that there is not an x at the location that bisect left told us to look at, then there's no x in the array so we raise an error. The last thing that I want to mention is that the bisect library in Python already has bisect left and bisect right implemented for you. So if you need to do a bisection, prefer using the builtin Python bisect library. You don't need to install anything in order to use it. That's all I have for today. I hope this helped you understand binary search a little bit better. If you like this video please consider subscribing.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hi, I'm Gail LockeMcDowell, author of Cracking Coding Interview. Today I'm going to cover binary search. So binary search is a very intuitive algorithm, and I'm going to show how intuitive it is by giving an example. You're a teacher and you're teaching a group of students, a very large class of 300 students, and you have their papers alphabetized out in front of you when a student, Zach Peters, comes up to get his paper back. So you probably wouldn't go through the papers, starting with Alex to Andy to Andrew, and then to Bob and Brenda and Brandy, and then to Chris and Christine, and you probably wouldn't do it that way. What you'd probably do is open the paper, open the stack of papers to roughly halfway through the papers and compare it. Zach Peters, well, then you open up halfway through and you see Michael Matters there, and you'd say, okay, Zach Peters is after that name. And then you take the second stack of papers and you'd treat it as its own little stack, and you'd again say, okay, let me open up to its midpoint. Maybe we see Sarah. Well, is Sarah before or after Zach Peters? And then you just go and repeat this process over and over and over again until you find Zach's paper, or until you find out Zach can't be in here. And this is the basics of binary search. So in an integer array it looks like this. You take some element that you're looking for, like 13, and you compare it to the midpoint. And it has to be a sorted array for this to work, it's very important. And you compare it to the midpoint. 13 is less than this midpoint, and so 13, if it's in the array at all, it has to be on the left side. And then you'd repeat this process on the left side and say, let me look at the midpoint of the left side. Is 13 before and after that? Before or after that? And you just repeat that process until you either find 13 or you know that 13 can't be in it. So how fast is this algorithm? Well, let's imagine we start off with n elements. So we have a search space of n elements. In a single comparison, just one, we've cut our search space down to n over 2. Then with one more comparison we cut it down to n over 4, and then and half again and half and half and half and half again. So how many total operations, in the very worst case, will we have to run until we figure out if it contains an element or not? Well, the total number of operations we'll have to do is determined by how many times can we divide n by 2 until we get down to just 1. So this is what log of n expresses, or log base 2 of n expresses. So if you pause the video, you can study that math for a second and see the relationship between those two things. But this means that binary search is a log n problem. Let's look now at the implementation of binary search. To implement binary search, we can either implement it recursively or iteratively. We'll do a recursive implementation first. So I'm going to just copy and paste here some just straightforward code for the binary search call. So this is an initial method that calls off to this binary search recursive method with the right parameters. So we're going to start off initially with left being 0 and right being the very right point. So these are inclusive endpoints. So first of all, if things get kind of too big, if left winds up bigger than right, then we know we have an error, we can't find it, and we want to return true. Otherwise, we want to pick the midpoint. So left dot right divided by 2, that's going to be the midpoint. And if we found the element, if array of mid is actually this element we're looking for, then we should return true. Otherwise, if x is on the left side of mid, then go search the left side. So pass an array, x, and left will stay as is and the right point will move to one next to the mid. Otherwise, go search the right side. So we want to call a very similar method, but now the left point moves up to mid plus 1 and right stays as is. Ok, so that's how the binary search recursive implementation looks. So one little minor pitfall is that, and some people like to be careful of it, is that left plus right can actually overflow with java integers. So if you'd like to avoid the integer overflow issue, you can actually just do this instead and this will prevent the overflow. It's kind of up to you, but this is one way of doing it. Ok, so now that we've done the recursive implementation, let's turn to the iterative implementation. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually tweak this recursive implementation. I'm going to copy paste it into a new function and I'm going to tweak it to make it iterative. So I'm going to call this iterative and I no longer need parameters in here, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to set, so I'm going to show you how you can tweak it. So I'm going to set left to be that right is going to start off at the rightmost position in the array. So now I want to iterate as long, I want to loop through this as long as left and right are such in the correct positions. So change this to a while loop. Alright, and then if I exit here then I haven't found it. Ok, so this looks correct and then here I don't want to actually recurse anymore. What I want to do is essentially take these values here. So left is going to stay as is and right is going to move to mid minus 1. I'm going to comment that out and I'll delete it shortly. And then here, rather than, so left is going to stay, or left is going to become mid plus 1 and right is going to stay as is. So that's how easy it is to tweak it from recursive to iterative. So that's how we implement binary search. Now remember that it can be implemented recursively or iteratively and it can also be applied to other data like strings or something else, but it must always operate on something that's sorted. So now that you've seen the implementation of binary search, why don't you try to do binary search on a new data type like a string. Good luck!```"

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Alright, binary search. It's a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or other collection. In order for a binary search to work, whatever we're searching through, it needs to be sorted. And basically what we do is we take half of the array and eliminate it during each step, and we will whittle down our collection until there is only one element remaining. In this example, I have an array of 11 elements. Each element contains a letter, and they're all sorted alphabetically. Let's say we are looking for the letter h, and I need the index. What we would do with a binary search is that we always begin in the middle. We first check to see if our target value is equal to this middle value. If these are equal, then we can return this index, but odds are they're probably not going to be equal on the very first turn, the very first step. So these are not equal. Then we will check to see if our target value is greater than or less than this middle value. Since h is greater than f, we can disregard this entire first half of our array, because since this is sorted, our target value could not possibly be within this first portion. And then we begin step two, or phase two. It's the same process as before. So again, we begin in the middle, check to see if our target value is equal to the middle value. If they're not, check to see if our target value is greater than or less than the middle value. This time h is less than i. We would delete the second half of this portion. We're not actually deleting these values, we're disregarding them. And then we can move on to step three. We're repeating the same process as before, and this time these elements divide evenly. So we would just round down and begin and say that this is the middle. So h is greater than g. We would disregard this element, and we only have h remaining. So we would return this index, because these values are equal. And that's a binary search. Now a binary search isn't too efficient when working with small data sets. However, if you're working with a large data set, like one million elements, well then a binary search is actually fantastic, because we're eliminating half of the elements we are searching through during each phase or turn. So if we had a million elements after the first phase, we can already disregard like half a million elements, and then we just repeat the process until there's only one left. So if this was an iterative approach, we would need to search through these linearly, beginning with index zero and going all the way to a million. So a binary search is fantastic with large data sets. The runtime complexity of a binary search is O of log n. The larger the data set, a binary search becomes more and more efficient compared to other search algorithms. All right, let's perform a binary search in real life now. We'll use the builtin binary search method of arrays to begin with, and then later on we'll build our own binary search function. So we'll need an array to work with. Let's say we have an array of integers named array. Int array, and the size of this array will be 100. We'll increase the size later for demonstration purposes, and we'll need a target value that we're searching for. I'll just name this target. Int target equals, what about 42? We'll search for the number 42, and we'll need to populate our array. So we can do so using a for loop. Int i equals zero. We will continue this for loop as long as i is less than array dot length, and increment i by one during each iteration. Then we will fill array at index i with whatever i is, our index. Okay, so the cheap way of using a binary search is to use the builtin binary search method of arrays. Let's say int index equals arrays dot binary search. And taking a look at this binary search method, there's two arguments that we have to pass in. An array, and whatever we're searching for. So we will pass in our array and our target, then return the index. And let's display that. So let's check to see if our index is equal to negative one. If our target is not found, then that means negative one will be returned from our binary search method. So let's print something. System dot out dot print line. What about element not found? Actually better yet, target not found. Let me change that. Target plus not found. Okay, then else. Else we will display system dot out dot print line. Element found at colon space plus index. All right, let's try it. Okay, element found at 42. Cool. Now let's create our own binary search function for practice. I'll turn this line into a comment, copy it, paste it, and get rid of this erase portion. Okay, then I'm just going to use a shortcut to generate this function. Okay, so private static int binary search. There are two parameters, an array of integers named array and int target. So we'll return negative one. That acts as a sentinel value. Negative one means that the value was not found. Now what we'll need at this point is the beginning and ending index of our array. So let's say int low will be the beginning and int high is the end. Array dot length minus one. So we have a low index and high index and we'll create a while loop. While low is less than or equal to high, we'll continue this while loop and keep on searching through our array. So first we need the middle index. Int middle, and here's the formula for that, low plus high minus low divided by two. So we have our middle index. We will take int value equals our array at index of middle. So this will extract that value found within this element. Okay, so this portion is optional. I'm just going to display whatever this value is so we can count the amount of steps it's going to take to find a value. So let's say middle colon space whatever this value is. This line of code is optional. I'm just doing this for educational purposes. Okay, now we need to check to see if our value is less than or greater than our target or equal to. If value is less than our target, low equals middle plus one. And actually I'm going to get rid of these curly braces. If you have an if statement and you only have like one line of code, you don't really need the curly braces. I'm just doing this so it's easier to read. Okay, else if value is greater than target, we will set our high index high equals middle minus one. Else, that means we have found our target. Else return middle. So this means that target is found. And by returning negative one, that means target not found. And that is our binary search function. Let's try it. Okay, element found at 42. So it took us let's see one, two, three, four, four steps to find the number 42 within this array of 100 elements. Now let's increase the size because binary searches do extremely well with large data sets. So let's say we have 1 million elements and let's change this target. What about 777,000, whatever that number is. Okay, so let's search for it and let's count the steps. So there's quite a number of steps here, but let's count them. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 20 steps. Now imagine if we took a linear approach where we began at index zero and looped through this entire array looking for this index. And in that case, looping through an array would have a runtime complexity of O of N to find this number. It's going to take over 700,000 steps because we're iterating once for each element within this array compared to a binary search where it only took 20 steps. Well then, in conclusion, a binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Half of the array is eliminated during each step or phase. So that's a binary search algorithm. If you would like a copy of all this code, of course, I will post this to the comment section down below. And that is the binary search algorithm in computer science. Hey you, yeah I'm talking to you. If you learned something new, then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button, drop a comment down below, and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```In this video, I'm going to go over the binary search algorithm in C. So the binary search algorithm allows us to find an element in a sorted array with a much quicker process than we could find an element in an unsorted array. So with an unsorted array, if we wanted to find the index of element 12, where is it in the array, basically? We'd probably have to search from the lefthand side to the righthand side one element at a time, because really we have nothing to go on as to where 12 could be in this array. So we're kind of stuck searching one element at a time from the lefthand side to the righthand side until we find 12. In the case of a sorted array, though, we could find the element with a much smarter process. So in the case of a sorted array, if we want to find the element 12, it probably wouldn't make sense to start at the leftmost element and go to the right, because what we'd probably want to check first is the middle element. If we check that middle element and 12 is greater than that middle element, we know that 12 is not going to be on this lefthand portion of the array. We know it must be in this right portion of the array, because the array is sorted. And if 12 is greater than 7, then we're going to have that it must be on this side of the array here. And we could continually apply this process. So we know that the element 12 must be on this side of the array now. We might as well just apply that process again and check the middle element. Here there's an even number of elements. There's six. So we'd probably have to pick between 10 or 11. It actually wouldn't really matter which one we choose, but we'd pick between 10 or 11 here. We'd say this is the middle element. And we'd say, is 12 greater than this middle element? Or is it less than it? It's greater than that middle element. So now we know that we don't have to consider this portion of the array. We can only look at this portion of the array. And what's happening here is that each time we sort of examine a middle element in some portion of the array where we want to find the element we're looking for, we're basically having each time the amount of remaining elements we need to look at. Because the first time we checked 7 here, we were able to eliminate half the elements in the array and say, we don't have to consider these. It can't be in there. And then we look at the remaining portion of the array here. We again have the elements that we need to look at. Because we looked at 10. We said, well, 12 must be in the righthand portion, because 12 is greater than 10. So we don't have to look at 8, 9, and 10. So again, we've wiped out half the elements. We don't have to look at these. And that's great. The less times we have to consider an element to see if that element is equal to 12, the faster it's going to be in terms of the algorithm and how long it takes to run. So now we'd only be looking at these three elements. And we'd say, let's look at the middle element here. And in this case, the middle element is going to be 12 itself. And we'd say, we're done. We've found where 12 is in the array. And we only had to check three numbers. We only had to check 7, 10, and then we found 12. So a very, very fast algorithm, a very fast way of solving the problem, compared to this process here, where we had to check a bunch of elements here before we eventually found 12. And that's because a sorted array, it gives us some information to go on, to guide us, to find the element. So let's actually implement that process, which is called binary search. So we'll make a function here, int binarySearch. And the function is going to accept an array as an argument, the element we're looking for. And it's going to have a left index and a right index. So we're going to use the left and right index to constrain the portion of the array that we're looking at when we call this function. And we're going to actually solve this problem recursively by having the binary search function call itself with increasingly constrained portions of the array, where we're going to be looking for that element. So the first time we call the function, it's actually going to look like this. We'll say binarySearch, and we'll say try to find in the sorted array, we'll say the element 12. And the left index is going to be 0, and the right index is going to be 12. So the left and right index, they're going to be the leftmost index that we want to find 12 in potentially, and the rightmost index, where we want to find 12 in potentially. Because initially we want to try to find 12 in the entire array. And the leftmost index would be index 0, the rightmost index would be index 12, the last index in the array. Remember that arrays in C are zero index, so this 13th element here would actually be index 12. So that's what's going to happen the first time we call binarySearch, is we're going to call it basically trying to find this element in the entire array. But what we're going to do is we're going to continually examine the middle element in the array, and we're going to manipulate the left and right arguments to constrain the portion of the array in which we're trying to find the element. So let's actually first find the midpoint in the array. We'll say here int mid is equal to L plus R minus L divided by 2. So this is going to give us the midpoint in the portion of the array that we're considering. So when we try to find the midpoint initially, it's going to be the actual middle of the array itself. But eventually the midpoint is going to be something that's potentially the midpoint of a portion of the array. Because like let's say we're trying to find 12, right? Well then we're not we're not going to find it at 7. We're going to find that we have to look at this portion of the array. When we look at this portion of the array and we go to calculate the midpoint, we're going to want to look at the midpoint from the left index to the right index. So in this case the midpoint is not the midpoint of the entire array. The midpoint is going to be the midpoint of where the left index is and the right index. And that midpoint is not just like the midpoint of the array itself. It's the midpoint of this portion of the array. So if this math here looks a little bit more complicated, that's what's going on. We're saying basically find the midpoint from that left index to the right index. So then the first thing we're going to do is see if we found the element at the midpoint. So we'll say here if the array at the midpoint is equal to the element we're trying to find, we found it. And we could say return the midpoint because we found the element at the midpoint. Otherwise we're going to have to do the trickier step where we actually constrain the portion of the array that we're going to continue to look at. So we're going to say here else if the array at the midpoint is greater than the element that we're trying to look for. So if the array at the midpoint is greater than the element we're trying to look for, then we know the element we're trying to look for must be in the left portion of the array. Because if we're trying to look for let's say four, and at the midpoint here we've got seven, we know it must be in the lefthand portion of the array. So what we're going to do is we're going to return the result of calling binary search with that left portion of the array. So we'll say binary search return the result of calling binary search with the array, the element we want to find, and we're going to say here the left index and mid minus one. So what this is going to do is it's going to basically keep the existing left index as the the new left index when we call binary search again, but the right index we're going to change now and we're going to change it to be mid minus one. Because if we just checked say element seven here and we just want to check to see you know where is four in this array here. Well we check seven and we determine that you know four is less than seven. Then we just want to check this portion of the array right. So we're going to keep the same left index but we're going to constrain now the right index and we're going to say look at the index up until one to the left of the current mid mid index right. So it's going to be between there and there now that we're going to be looking at. And that's what this does is it sort of makes the new rightmost element we want to consider one to the left of the current middle index. Which makes sense because if we just look at seven we want to go up to here right one to the left of the current middle index. And then the final case here is we're going to say else if if it's this case we know that the element is actually greater than the middle index. So else if the element is greater than the middle index we're going to consider the right hand side of the array. So we'll say return binary search a e and we'll say here mid plus one r. So what we're doing this time is we're effectively altering the left index when we call binary search. And we're saying we want to now look at the the right hand portion of the array or the right hand portion of this section of the array that we're looking at. And so here mid plus one if you consider this case here where we're looking at seven again maybe we're trying to find 12 right. So we're trying to find 12 we're looking at seven what we want to look at is this element here as the new leftmost element. The element one to the right of the current midpoint. And that's what that would give us is the leftmost element to look at would be now one to the right of the current middle element. So that's going to then cut up the problem for us like that. Continue looking at the left portion of the portion of the array we're looking at and the right portion of the current portion of the array we're looking at. Now the one thing we've got to look for is it's possible that the element is just not in the array at all. So if the element is just not in the array at all eventually what's going to happen is we would actually pass a left index that would actually be greater than the right index. That's what's going to eventually happen if we continue to follow this process. We're going to pass a left index into this function here that's going to be greater than the right index. If that ever happens we know we're done and we know that we just can't find the element in the array. So if that's the case here we'll say if the left index is greater than the right index we know we're done we just can't find it and we're going to return negative one. And negative one is going to be our special value to say that we just couldn't find it because negative one doesn't even make sense as an index right. Indexes have to go from zero one two three four five on up. So if we return negative one as the index we're basically saying we couldn't find it. So we'll try to call this function now and we'll try to store the index. We'll say int index is equal to binary search and we'll print it out. We'll say the index of 12 and we'll output that index. In this case the index of 12 should be 11 there again because arrays in C are zero indexed. So we'll give this a run here and we get the the index of 12 is 11 and it's worked. We give it another test here we could say the index of let's say three and we'll try to find three and the index of three should be two right because zero one two. So we'll save this give it a run and we get that the index of three is two and it seems to be working. We give it one more test here we could say what is the index of we'll say maybe 14 and we'll try to find 14. In this case we just shouldn't be able to find 14 and we should get back negative one. So run this here we get the index of 14 is negative one and so we've implemented the binary search algorithm in C.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Welcome to TutorialsU, my name is Yannick and in this video we are going to talk about the binary search algorithm and we will take a look on how it is working in the background, so what exactly it is doing. So if you don't know the binary search algorithm yet, well, it's a very efficient way on how you can find an index of a specific value in an array or in a list, for example. So here we got an integer array and let's say we want to get the index of the value 6, so that would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right, and the binary search method, as you can call on an array, for example, when you just put in the array and the value you are searching for will then return the index, so let's see if I hit start, that should be, like, 5, as I said, let's give it a moment, the number 6 is at index 5, just as I said. So let's start thinking about what is happening in the background and why this is a very efficient way on how you can find specific values. We also got the content of the video written as a blog article at our website, you can find the link for that in the description below. We also provide an example of a custom binary search using a Person class there, very exciting, so check it out. Now, understanding this algorithm is quite simple, so if we have an array, we just need to make sure that it is sorted, so this is, well, at very first one of the big downsides of this binary search, the array or the list or whatever collection you want to use, it has to be sorted, so for sure we can use link to sort that array and afterwards we can then use the binary search. Now, if we compare that to a linear search, the binary search is definitely way more efficient and this is because the binary search algorithm only has to iterate through the array logarithmically. Now, what exactly is he doing when we try to find the value 6? So, basically, what he's going to do is, we have in total, we have 7 elements here, right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, so we have an odd number of elements. He goes exactly into the middle of the array, so that would be 4. We got 1, 2, 3 on the left side, 5, 6, 7 on the right side. Now, if we have an even number of elements, so let's say, let me just add one here, we got 8 now, well, what is the middle, right? The middle is like 4.5, so the value between 4 and 5 is 4.5, great, or 4.5, just to make it easier for you to understand. So, in that way, he would go to 4.5. Now, if we have that odd number, as I said, he would simply go to 4. Now, he will see, okay, is this my value? We are searching for 6, right? Keep that in mind. So, he will see, okay, the value that I got in the middle is 4, but I'm searching for 6. So, no, this is not my value. We now have a left side from that 4 position where we are, now we have a right side. Now, I don't want to make it too complex in that code editor, this is why I now open up some smaller images, just to make a better visual representation of all of that. So, here we got our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 array and keep in mind, we are searching for the value 6. As I said, he will now go into the middle of the array, which is 4, so we have a left side and a right side and he now checks, okay, is the middle value my desired value? No, but if it would be, the search would be completed, he would point to 6, he would say, all right, I immediately found the correct index. Now, 4 is smaller than 6, which basically means 6 is bigger, so he will go to the right side. If we would search for 2, he would go to the left side now. He would just perform that action again. So, let's say, okay, on the right side we got 5, 6, 7. Now, that chunk of the array will just, it will get repeated as it did before. Now, he will use that chunk of the array, 5, 6, 7, the right side from that middle outgoing and try to operate the same thing again. So, he will again take 5, 6, 7, go to the middle element and then we will have 5, 6, 7, as I said, and he will see, yes, that middle element this time is the correct one, right? So, he will say, yes, I found the correct element, I found the correct value and the index in that scenario is 5. So, this is basically what he's doing. He always goes to the next middle element. He takes the entire array, goes to the middle element, checks, is this the correct element? If yes, we're done. If not, is it bigger or smaller? If it's smaller, go to the left side. If it's bigger, go to the right side and this goes on and on and on and on until we found our element. So, right here, it's quite simple, right? Because we only have seven elements, but if we would have like a thousand, then this would be a lot of iterations. Great, and that's it already. So, this is how a binary search is working. Now, for all of you geeks out there, if you want to know it, the algorithm is super efficient because it has a time complexity of logarithmic, as I said it initially, in comparison to, let's say, a linear search, where we have O, N, where N is the size of the array. But in that case, we're going through the iterations or the iterations are passing through the array logarithmically and this is why it is more efficient.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Welcome back, aliens! My name is Ravindra Reddy and let's continue with the series on Python. In the last video, we have worked on linear search, right? So, we were having a list and out of that list, we want to search for a particular element. So, if the element is there, it will say found and it will also show the location, right, or the position of it. If the element is not there, it will simply print not found. So, linear search is good, right? But then what if you have a list of, let's say, 1000 values and the value which you're searching for is on, let's say, after 800 values. So, you're wasting so much of time. So, as your list length increases, it will increase the time as well. So, do we have a better way? And yes, we have one more search technique, which is a binary search. How that works? So, before continuing with binary search, you have to understand in binary search, all the values have to be sorted, okay? So, normally, when you work with linear search, it's not compulsory to have the values sorted, we can have values in any order. But in case of binary search, you have to make sure that your values are sorted. That means if I provide initial values, example, we are putting values like this, right? So, we will change it, we will have a value which is sorted, right? So, let's say 4, 7, 8, 12, 45, 99. So, let's say we have this value. So, we have six values, I want to search for a particular value. So, instead of going for a linear search here, we will go for binary search. Now, how that works? So, let's imagine we have a list here, right? And if you want to search for an element, what you will do is you will first specify the lower bound and the upper bound, okay? So, as you can see, the first value is a lower bound here. So, the first value itself is a lower bound. And the last value is the upper bound. You can say first or last, but then let's go with this word L or U. So, L is the first index and U is the last index. Once you have assigned this thing, the next step you have to do is you have to find a midindex. Now, how do you find a midindex? As names suggest mid, it should be a midpoint of this lower and upper, right? So, you will simply say lower plus upper divided by two, you will get midvalue. Now, whenever you say midvalue, so in this case, you can see we got the midvalue there, right? So, the element, let's say, okay, so before going ahead, let me find element, let's specify the element. I want to search 45, okay? So, if you want to search 45, so you can see we got the midvalue, right? So, what's the midvalue? So, the index value for 4 is 0. The index value for 99 is 5. So, 0 plus 5 is 5 and 5 divided by 2 is 2, right? So, we are doing integer division here, right? We are not doing float division. So, we are doing int division. So, it will give you 2. So, the value at index value 2, so basically our mid is 2 now. So, the value at that index is 8, right? So, now we got 8 as the midvalue. The next step is you have to check the midvalue which you have got is matching with the element which you're searching for. The element we are searching for is 45, right? So, it's not matching. Now, the next step would be you have to change your lower bound or upper bound. For the next iteration, you have to change your lower bound or upper bound. Now, which one to change? For this, you have to check the value you're searching for is smaller or bigger than the midvalue. If the value is smaller, change your upper bound. That means you will simply say the midvalue is the new upper bound. If your value is greater than the midvalue, so the midvalue here is 8, right? And the value which you are searching for is 45. So, now you have to change your lower bound. So, what you will do is, so the old lower bound, now it will shift to the midvalue. So, your m becomes l, right? So, instead of having a big list, now you got a small list, right? So, the list start with 8 and it ends at 99. Now, you got a new lower and the upper value. So, what you will do, you will again find the midvalue. So, that's what you do every time. So, your lower plus upper. So, what is your lower? Lower is basically 2 and your upper is 5. 2 plus 5 is 7. 7 divided by 2 is 3, right? So, now 12 becomes your new midvalue. Is it matching? Again, the same thing. It's not matching, right? We are searching for 45. Now, you have to change your lower value again because 45 is bigger than 12. So, you will shift your lower value to 12 now. So, your 12 is the lower value and 99 is the upper value. So, what you will do now is you will simply say mid again. The lower value is 3. The upper value is 5. So, mid becomes 4 and at 4, we have 45, right? So, now you will check and you got the value. Now, you might be thinking, oh, is it a good way of doing that? And the answer is yes because in the initial level, you are skipping some values. You are not checking all the values. If your list is big, it will skip a lot of values which you are not checking, okay? So, it will improve the speed as well. The only thing is you have to, the values which you are taking should be sorted. Let's implement this with the code now. So, what we are going to do is let's keep the same code. We have the list of values here. Let's search for 45. And so, we are saying search, list. We are passing the list. We are passing n. But we have to change something, right? We have to change the logic here. So, let me just remove the entire stuff. This is something which will change, right? Now, the first thing is you have to mention the lower bound, upper bound, right? So, you will say l is equal to 0. So, you will always start l with 0. And you will say u which is the upper bound. So, l is lower bound, u is upper bound. Upper bound will be the length of the added, right? So, you will say length of the least minus 1 because it should be 1 less than this term. Now, once you got the lower and upper, let's apply a loop. This time, again, I will go with a while loop. Now, till what point you have to reach there? So, you have to stop at two scenarios. One, the moment you found the value. And second, your lower bound should not be greater than upper bound, okay? If that happens, you have to stop it. So, your lower bound should be always less than or equal to the upper bound, okay? It should be less than or equal to, okay? It should not be greater than equal to. And then you have to also stop at the moment you find the value, right? So, let's do that later. So, in this while, you have to find the mid value now, right? So, once we got lower, once we got upper, every time you have to find the mid value. So, you will take mid is equal to, how do you find mid? It's lower plus upper by 2, right? So, you will say lower plus upper. And if you say divided by 2, so you will keep that in bracket. Now, you want an integer division, right? You don't want a normal division. So, you will use double slash which we have done before. Double slash will give you integer division and you got mid value. Now, you will check if the mid value, so mid index. So, we have to find the value for the mid index, right? And the way you do that is by saying list of mid. If this is matching with the value which you're searching for which is n, our job is done, right? You will simply print found. In fact, I also want to mention the position, right? So, you will say pause is equal to mid because that's the position you were looking for. Oh, but pause becomes a local variable, right? So, let's make it global variable here. We are saving that position as well. And then you have to do one more thing. We simply have to say break, right? That's very important or we can simply say return true. Why I'm using semicolon everywhere. That's it. Once you got the value, you will simply return true. Otherwise, what if the value is not there? So, you will go for else. If the value is not matching in else, you have to do some extra stuff which is you have to say if. Now, you have to change your lower bound, upper bound, right? Because if you remember, if your mid value is not matching with the value which you're searching for, you have to change your lower bound or the upper bound. Which one to change? Depending upon the value is greater than the mid value or smaller than the mid value. So, you will check list of mid is smaller. If it is smaller than the mid value, you have to go, you have to change your upper bound, right? So, you will say if that is smaller than the value which you're searching for, which is n, change the lower bound. And in the other case, you have to change the upper bound. Now, let's see if that works. I feel something is wrong, but let's verify. So, what I will do is I will simply run this code. It works. You can see that it says found at 5. Is it right? 4, 7, 8, 12 and 5. 45. That's great, right? And let me just do it for some other value now. Let's say maybe 7. And you can see if you're searching for 7, it will still work. You can see it says 2. And if you have a bigger list as well, let me just add some more values to here. So, it doesn't matter how big value you're searching for. And let me search for 1, 0, 9, 8, 7. The moment you search for this, around this, you can see it says at 9 position. Is it right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. That's great. So, this is how you do a binary search. So, just to repeat, just to reiterate what we are doing here is, so, we got the lower bound, we got the upper bound, and then you are finding the mid value. So, mid value is basically the addition of lower bound, upper bound divided by 2, okay? Now, once you've got the mid value, you have to compare that mid value with the value which you're searching for. If it is matching, that's great. So, if it is not matching, in that scenario, you will again find a new mid value. But before finding a new mid value, you have to change your lower bound or the upper bound. So, because you have to reduce the size of the array or the list, right? So, depending upon is it belongs to right hand side or left hand side, you will change it. So, that's how it works. But then we have not done for something which is not there. Example, if I search for 10, and you can see we don't have 10. It should print not found, right? It is not printing anything. So, at the end here, you have to return false. Because ultimately, you're working with true and false. And don't use semicolon because I work on the languages which use semicolon there. Let's ignore that. Oh, it's still not working. It's still not says not found. Is it we have to do plus one? So, for the lower bound, you have to shift to the mid plus one for the upper bound. Because see, if mid is not available, then why you have to even check for mid now, right? Mid is done. So, you have to say L is equal to mid plus one. But for upper bound, you have to say minus one, because you have to skip that mid value, right? I guess that's the issue. Let's run this code. Oh, you can see it says not found. That's great. So, we got the output. This is how you do one is search. Okay. So, watch this video once again and do practice. That's how you will improve your skills. So, I hope you are enjoying this video. Let me know in the comment section and do subscribe for further videos.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hello and welcome. I'm James Murphy, and today we're talking about binary search. Binary search, also called bisection search, is an algorithm for finding an element quickly in a sorted array. Suppose we're trying to find 7 in this array. Is it in the left half or the right half? The right half. And then repeat. Finally, there's just one element left. That's our 7. Even though it's one of the first algorithms that one learns, it's also extremely important. Analyzing binary search is often the branching point for studying things like time complexities of algorithms and big O notation. Here you can see we started with 8 elements, and at each step we ruled out half of them. This idea of ruling out half of all the possibilities at each step is where binary search or bisection search gets its name. This is also where it gets its logarithmic time complexity from. So binary search is useful, fundamental, and simple. And yet, a huge percentage of programmers, even professional programmers, struggle to write binary search. How can the idea be so simple, but the implementation be so difficult? Well, it's not so difficult. You just have to think about it in the right way. The first thing we should decide on is, are we returning the object that we find, or the index that it was at? The index itself is a more useful piece of information. We can always just grab the object at that index later. But what do we do if the object we're looking for isn't there? Do we do something like return negative one, or maybe raise an exception? Or what if there are multiple valid indices to choose from? With every arbitrary choice that we make, we would have to remember the implementation details that go with that choice. A better way to do it is to rephrase the question so that there is always exactly one answer. So here's how I would rephrase the question. If I were going to add another seven into this sorted array, where should I put it so that it's the first seven? Notice that in this hypothetical, I'm always adding the seven into the array. That guarantees the array is nonempty and always contains at least one seven. But if it contains at least one seven, then there is always a unique first seven. The index of that first seven is the answer to my question. It doesn't matter whether or not the original array had a seven or multiple sevens in it. The location of the first seven in the new array is always uniquely determined. If there were no sevens, I would have to put it here to maintain the sorting property. And if there are already sevens, it would have to be the index of the first already existing one. Even if the array were empty, I still get a valid answer. In this case, I would have to insert the seven at index zero. Notice that zero is not a valid index into this array, but it still makes sense because the question that I asked was where should I insert it. And it certainly makes sense to insert it at index zero. The same applies for a nonempty array. Binary search might tell me that I have to put it at the end. As long as you keep in mind this interpretation of what binary search is supposed to return, it's much harder to get confused. I think that far too often binary search is taught solely as an algorithm that works on sorted arrays. But the array being sorted, I claim, is not actually the property that we're using here. Here, look, I changed some of the elements and this array is no longer in sorted order. But notice the steps are exactly the same. What we need is that everything less than seven is on the left and everything bigger than seven is on the right. In this array, the numbers have been replaced with the important information. Is this number less than seven? Notice how any trues are on the left and any falses are on the right. So now that we're looking at the relevant data, where do we insert seven so that it is the first seven? Notice that the answer that we're looking for is the index of the first false value, or the end of the array if there are no false values. This is the key insight that we need to keep in mind that makes the implementation extremely easy to remember. Squint your eyes and find the first false value. Okay, let's write the implementation. Low and high are lower and upper bounds on where this first false index is. Zero would mean the first value is false and length of the array would mean that all of the values are true, so we would need to put x at the end. The idea is that we are going to continually increase our lower bound and decrease our upper bound until they're equal. Low and high will meet at the unique index that we're looking for, so we could return either low or high. It makes no difference. We compute mid, which is the closest index to the middle between low and high. Python can represent arbitrarily large integers so we don't need to worry about overflow, but if you're doing this in another language besides Python you might have to worry about overflow. In that case you can represent the midpoint equivalently by writing it as low plus half the distance between low and high. If you write it this way it will never overflow. Next comes the part of the algorithm that is most often written incorrectly. We need to compare whatever's in the array at the midpoint with our given x and then update the lower or upper bound accordingly. Remember we're looking for the first false value where true or false is determined by asking the question, is this less than x? Well in this section the middle value is less than x. It is a true value. Since the value at mid is a true value the earliest a false value could occur is the next one, which is mid plus one. What about if we see a false value? In this case the first false value couldn't be any later than mid because there is a false value at mid, but it could be earlier. There might be other false values before the one that we've found. That means the best we can do is update our upper bound to be whatever mid is. And there you have it. This is a correct implementation. But how can we reason about it? How do we know that this actually gives the right answer? Well we know that low is always less than or equal to the correct answer is always less than or equal to high, and we do keep updating the lower and higher bounds, but how do we know that they actually meet so that the loop stops? It's enough to show that every iteration the difference between high and low always decreases by at least one. If we enter this clause the plus one ensures that low always increases by at least one. In this clause we're setting high to mid, so hopefully we're lowering high, but how do we know that mid was actually strictly less than high? Here we're actually using that integer division rounds down. Inside the while loop low is less than high, so low plus high is strictly less than high plus high. That means that when we divide by two and round down we'll get something strictly less than high. It's common to take low and high as optional parameters so that if you already have a lower or upper bound you can make use of that. And of course don't forget to check that the parameters are valid. And that's all there is to it. But wait, you ask, instead of returning the index to insert a 7 so that it would be the first 7, couldn't I also return the index so that it would be the last 7? Yeah, you could. You could follow essentially the same analysis and get a very similar algorithm. To find where it should go to be the first 7, the relevant piece of information is is it strictly less than 7. To find where it should go to be the last 7, you want to know is it less than or equal to 7. In either case the index that you're looking for is the first false value. You just need to decide on what you mean by true and false. The first one is called bisect left and the second bisect right. So this one that we already wrote is bisect left. Can you tell me what you need to change in order to make it bisect right? Here's an example of how you might use bisect left. For this function we want to find the index of the first x in the array or throw an error if there isn't one. Since we're looking for the first index we'll use bisect left. If there is already an x in the array, bisect left will return the index of the first one. So we would like to just check at that index and see if we see an x. If we don't get back a valid index or if we find that there is not an x at the location that bisect left told us to look at, then there's no x in the array so we raise an error. The last thing that I want to mention is that the bisect library in Python already has bisect left and bisect right implemented for you. So if you need to do a bisection, prefer using the builtin Python bisect library. You don't need to install anything in order to use it. That's all I have for today. I hope this helped you understand binary search a little bit better. If you like this video please consider subscribing. And as always don't forget to slap that like button an odd number of times.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hi, I'm Gail LockeMcDowell, author of Cracking Coding Interview. Today I'm going to cover binary search. So binary search is a very intuitive algorithm, and I'm going to show how intuitive it is by giving an example. You're a teacher and you're teaching a group of students, a very large class of 300 students, and you have their papers alphabetized out in front of you when a student, Zach Peters, comes up to get his paper back. So you probably wouldn't go through the papers, starting with Alex to Andy to Andrew, and then to Bob and Brenda and Brandy, and then to Chris and Christine, and you probably wouldn't do it that way. What you'd probably do is open the paper, open the stack of papers to roughly halfway through the papers and compare it. Zach Peters, well, then you open up halfway through and you see Michael Matters there, and you'd say, okay, Zach Peters is after that name. And then you take the second stack of papers and you'd treat it as its own little stack, and you'd again say, okay, let me open up to its midpoint. Maybe we see Sarah. Well, is Sarah before or after Zach Peters? And then you just go and repeat this process over and over and over again until you find Zach's paper, or until you find out Zach can't be in here. And this is the basics of binary search. So in an integer array it looks like this. You take some element that you're looking for, like 13, and you compare it to the midpoint. And it has to be a sorted array for this to work, it's very important. And you compare it to the midpoint. 13 is less than this midpoint, and so 13, if it's in the array at all, it has to be on the left side. And then you'd repeat this process on the left side and say, let me look at the midpoint of the left side. Is 13 before and after that? Before or after that? And you just repeat that process until you either find 13 or you know that 13 can't be in it. So how fast is this algorithm? Well, let's imagine we start off with n elements. So we have a search space of n elements. In a single comparison, just one, we've cut our search space down to n over 2. Then with one more comparison we cut it down to n over 4, and then and half again and half and half and half and half again. So how many total operations, in the very worst case, will we have to run until we figure out if it contains an element or not? Well, the total number of operations we'll have to do is determined by how many times can we divide n by 2 until we get down to just 1. So this is what log of n expresses, or log base 2 of n expresses. So if you pause the video, you can study that math for a second and see the relationship between those two things. But this means that binary search is a log n problem. Let's look now at the implementation of binary search. To implement binary search, we can either implement it recursively or iteratively. We'll do a recursive implementation first. So I'm going to just copy and paste here some just straightforward code for the binary search call. So this is an initial method that calls off to this binary search recursive method with the right parameters. So we're going to start off initially with left being 0 and right being the very right point. So these are inclusive endpoints. So first of all, if things get kind of too big, if left winds up bigger than right, then we know we have an error, we can't find it, and we want to return true. Otherwise, we want to pick the midpoint. So left dot right divided by 2, that's going to be the midpoint. And if we found the element, if array of mid is actually this element we're looking for, then we should return true. Otherwise, if x is on the left side of mid, then go search the left side. So pass an array, x, and left will stay as is and the right point will move to one next to the mid. Otherwise, go search the right side. So we want to call a very similar method, but now the left point moves up to mid plus 1 and right stays as is. Ok, so that's how the binary search recursive implementation looks. So one little minor pitfall is that, and some people like to be careful of it, is that left plus right can actually overflow with java integers. So if you'd like to avoid the integer overflow issue, you can actually just do this instead and this will prevent the overflow. It's kind of up to you, but this is one way of doing it. Ok, so now that we've done the recursive implementation, let's turn to the iterative implementation. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually tweak this recursive implementation. I'm going to copy paste it into a new function and I'm going to tweak it to make it iterative. So I'm going to call this iterative and I no longer need parameters in here, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to set, so I'm going to show you how you can tweak it. So I'm going to set left to be that right is going to start off at the rightmost position in the array. So now I want to iterate as long, I want to loop through this as long as left and right are such in the correct positions. So change this to a while loop. Alright, and then if I exit here then I haven't found it. Ok, so this looks correct and then here I don't want to actually recurse anymore. What I want to do is essentially take these values here. So left is going to stay as is and right is going to move to mid minus 1. I'm going to comment that out and I'll delete it shortly. And then here, rather than, so left is going to stay, or left is going to become mid plus 1 and right is going to stay as is. So that's how easy it is to tweak it from recursive to iterative. So that's how we implement binary search. Now remember that it can be implemented recursively or iteratively and it can also be applied to other data like strings or something else, but it must always operate on something that's sorted. So now that you've seen the implementation of binary search, why don't you try to do binary search on a new data type like a string. Good luck!```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```Hey everyone, it's your bro. Hope you're doing well, and in this video I'm going to explain the binary search algorithm in computer science. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Alright, binary search. It's a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array or other collection. In order for a binary search to work, whatever we're searching through, it needs to be sorted. And basically what we do is we take half of the array and eliminate it during each step, and we will whittle down our collection until there is only one element remaining. In this example, I have an array of 11 elements. Each element contains a letter, and they're all sorted alphabetically. Let's say we are looking for the letter h, and I need the index. What we would do with a binary search is that we always begin in the middle. We first check to see if our target value is equal to this middle value. If these are equal, then we can return this index, but odds are they're probably not going to be equal on the very first turn, the very first step. So these are not equal. Then we will check to see if our target value is greater than or less than this middle value. Since h is greater than f, we can disregard this entire first half of our array, because since this is sorted, our target value could not possibly be within this first portion. And then we begin step two, or phase two. It's the same process as before. So again, we begin in the middle, check to see if our target value is equal to the middle value. If they're not, check to see if our target value is greater than or less than the middle value. This time h is less than i. We would delete the second half of this portion. We're not actually deleting these values, we're disregarding them. And then we can move on to step three. We're repeating the same process as before, and this time these elements divide evenly. So we would just round down and begin and say that this is the middle. So h is greater than g. We would disregard this element, and we only have h remaining. So we would return this index, because these values are equal. And that's a binary search. Now a binary search isn't too efficient when working with small data sets. However, if you're working with a large data set, like one million elements, well then a binary search is actually fantastic, because we're eliminating half of the elements we are searching through during each phase or turn. So if we had a million elements after the first phase, we can already disregard like half a million elements, and then we just repeat the process until there's only one left. So if this was an iterative approach, we would need to search through these linearly, beginning with index zero and going all the way to a million. So a binary search is fantastic with large data sets. The runtime complexity of a binary search is O of log n. The larger the data set, a binary search becomes more and more efficient compared to other search algorithms. All right, let's perform a binary search in real life now. We'll use the builtin binary search method of arrays to begin with, and then later on we'll build our own binary search function. So we'll need an array to work with. Let's say we have an array of integers named array. Int array, and the size of this array will be 100. We'll increase the size later for demonstration purposes, and we'll need a target value that we're searching for. I'll just name this target. Int target equals, what about 42? We'll search for the number 42, and we'll need to populate our array. So we can do so using a for loop. Int i equals zero. We will continue this for loop as long as i is less than array dot length, and increment i by one during each iteration. Then we will fill array at index i with whatever i is, our index. Okay, so the cheap way of using a binary search is to use the builtin binary search method of arrays. Let's say int index equals arrays dot binary search. And taking a look at this binary search method, there's two arguments that we have to pass in. An array, and whatever we're searching for. So we will pass in our array and our target, then return the index. And let's display that. So let's check to see if our index is equal to negative one. If our target is not found, then that means negative one will be returned from our binary search method. So let's print something. System dot out dot print line. What about element not found? Actually better yet, target not found. Let me change that. Target plus not found. Okay, then else. Else we will display system dot out dot print line. Element found at colon space plus index. All right, let's try it. Okay, element found at 42. Cool. Now let's create our own binary search function for practice. I'll turn this line into a comment, copy it, paste it, and get rid of this erase portion. Okay, then I'm just going to use a shortcut to generate this function. Okay, so private static int binary search. There are two parameters, an array of integers named array and int target. So we'll return negative one. That acts as a sentinel value. Negative one means that the value was not found. Now what we'll need at this point is the beginning and ending index of our array. So let's say int low will be the beginning and int high is the end. Array dot length minus one. So we have a low index and high index and we'll create a while loop. While low is less than or equal to high, we'll continue this while loop and keep on searching through our array. So first we need the middle index. Int middle, and here's the formula for that, low plus high minus low divided by two. So we have our middle index. We will take int value equals our array at index of middle. So this will extract that value found within this element. Okay, so this portion is optional. I'm just going to display whatever this value is so we can count the amount of steps it's going to take to find a value. So let's say middle colon space whatever this value is. This line of code is optional. I'm just doing this for educational purposes. Okay, now we need to check to see if our value is less than or greater than our target or equal to. If value is less than our target, low equals middle plus one. And actually I'm going to get rid of these curly braces. If you have an if statement and you only have like one line of code, you don't really need the curly braces. I'm just doing this so it's easier to read. Okay, else if value is greater than target, we will set our high index high equals middle minus one. Else, that means we have found our target. Else return middle. So this means that target is found. And by returning negative one, that means target not found. And that is our binary search function. Let's try it. Okay, element found at 42. So it took us let's see one, two, three, four, four steps to find the number 42 within this array of 100 elements. Now let's increase the size because binary searches do extremely well with large data sets. So let's say we have 1 million elements and let's change this target. What about 777,000, whatever that number is. Okay, so let's search for it and let's count the steps. So there's quite a number of steps here, but let's count them. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 20 steps. Now imagine if we took a linear approach where we began at index zero and looped through this entire array looking for this index. And in that case, looping through an array would have a runtime complexity of O of N to find this number. It's going to take over 700,000 steps because we're iterating once for each element within this array compared to a binary search where it only took 20 steps. Well then, in conclusion, a binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Half of the array is eliminated during each step or phase. So that's a binary search algorithm. If you would like a copy of all this code, of course, I will post this to the comment section down below. And that is the binary search algorithm in computer science. Hey you, yeah I'm talking to you. If you learned something new, then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button, drop a comment down below, and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro.```"

    "content": "Contents:\n```In this video, I'm going to go over the binary search algorithm in C. So the binary search algorithm allows us to find an element in a sorted array with a much quicker process than we could find an element in an unsorted array. So with an unsorted array, if we wanted to find the index of element 12, where is it in the array, basically? We'd probably have to search from the lefthand side to the righthand side one element at a time, because really we have nothing to go on as to where 12 could be in this array. So we're kind of stuck searching one element at a time from the lefthand side to the righthand side until we find 12. In the case of a sorted array, though, we could find the element with a much smarter process. So in the case of a sorted array, if we want to find the element 12, it probably wouldn't make sense to start at the leftmost element and go to the right, because what we'd probably want to check first is the middle element. If we check that middle element and 12 is greater than that middle element, we know that 12 is not going to be on this lefthand portion of the array. We know it must be in this right portion of the array, because the array is sorted. And if 12 is greater than 7, then we're going to have that it must be on this side of the array here. And we could continually apply this process. So we know that the element 12 must be on this side of the array now. We might as well just apply that process again and check the middle element. Here there's an even number of elements. There's six. So we'd probably have to pick between 10 or 11. It actually wouldn't really matter which one we choose, but we'd pick between 10 or 11 here. We'd say this is the middle element. And we'd say, is 12 greater than this middle element? Or is it less than it? It's greater than that middle element. So now we know that we don't have to consider this portion of the array. We can only look at this portion of the array. And what's happening here is that each time we sort of examine a middle element in some portion of the array where we want to find the element we're looking for, we're basically having each time the amount of remaining elements we need to look at. Because the first time we checked 7 here, we were able to eliminate half the elements in the array and say, we don't have to consider these. It can't be in there. And then we look at the remaining portion of the array here. We again have the elements that we need to look at. Because we looked at 10. We said, well, 12 must be in the righthand portion, because 12 is greater than 10. So we don't have to look at 8, 9, and 10. So again, we've wiped out half the elements. We don't have to look at these. And that's great. The less times we have to consider an element to see if that element is equal to 12, the faster it's going to be in terms of the algorithm and how long it takes to run. So now we'd only be looking at these three elements. And we'd say, let's look at the middle element here. And in this case, the middle element is going to be 12 itself. And we'd say, we're done. We've found where 12 is in the array. And we only had to check three numbers. We only had to check 7, 10, and then we found 12. So a very, very fast algorithm, a very fast way of solving the problem, compared to this process here, where we had to check a bunch of elements here before we eventually found 12. And that's because a sorted array, it gives us some information to go on, to guide us, to find the element. So let's actually implement that process, which is called binary search. So we'll make a function here, int binarySearch. And the function is going to accept an array as an argument, the element we're looking for. And it's going to have a left index and a right index. So we're going to use the left and right index to constrain the portion of the array that we're looking at when we call this function. And we're going to actually solve this problem recursively by having the binary search function call itself with increasingly constrained portions of the array, where we're going to be looking for that element. So the first time we call the function, it's actually going to look like this. We'll say binarySearch, and we'll say try to find in the sorted array, we'll say the element 12. And the left index is going to be 0, and the right index is going to be 12. So the left and right index, they're going to be the leftmost index that we want to find 12 in potentially, and the rightmost index, where we want to find 12 in potentially. Because initially we want to try to find 12 in the entire array. And the leftmost index would be index 0, the rightmost index would be index 12, the last index in the array. Remember that arrays in C are zero index, so this 13th element here would actually be index 12. So that's what's going to happen the first time we call binarySearch, is we're going to call it basically trying to find this element in the entire array. But what we're going to do is we're going to continually examine the middle element in the array, and we're going to manipulate the left and right arguments to constrain the portion of the array in which we're trying to find the element. So let's actually first find the midpoint in the array. We'll say here int mid is equal to L plus R minus L divided by 2. So this is going to give us the midpoint in the portion of the array that we're considering. So when we try to find the midpoint initially, it's going to be the actual middle of the array itself. But eventually the midpoint is going to be something that's potentially the midpoint of a portion of the array. Because like let's say we're trying to find 12, right? Well then we're not we're not going to find it at 7. We're going to find that we have to look at this portion of the array. When we look at this portion of the array and we go to calculate the midpoint, we're going to want to look at the midpoint from the left index to the right index. So in this case the midpoint is not the midpoint of the entire array. The midpoint is going to be the midpoint of where the left index is and the right index. And that midpoint is not just like the midpoint of the array itself. It's the midpoint of this portion of the array. So if this math here looks a little bit more complicated, that's what's going on. We're saying basically find the midpoint from that left index to the right index. So then the first thing we're going to do is see if we found the element at the midpoint. So we'll say here if the array at the midpoint is equal to the element we're trying to find, we found it. And we could say return the midpoint because we found the element at the midpoint. Otherwise we're going to have to do the trickier step where we actually constrain the portion of the array that we're going to continue to look at. So we're going to say here else if the array at the midpoint is greater than the element that we're trying to look for. So if the array at the midpoint is greater than the element we're trying to look for, then we know the element we're trying to look for must be in the left portion of the array. Because if we're trying to look for let's say four, and at the midpoint here we've got seven, we know it must be in the lefthand portion of the array. So what we're going to do is we're going to return the result of calling binary search with that left portion of the array. So we'll say binary search return the result of calling binary search with the array, the element we want to find, and we're going to say here the left index and mid minus one. So what this is going to do is it's going to basically keep the existing left index as the the new left index when we call binary search again, but the right index we're going to change now and we're going to change it to be mid minus one. Because if we just checked say element seven here and we just want to check to see you know where is four in this array here. Well we check seven and we determine that you know four is less than seven. Then we just want to check this portion of the array right. So we're going to keep the same left index but we're going to constrain now the right index and we're going to say look at the index up until one to the left of the current mid mid index right. So it's going to be between there and there now that we're going to be looking at. And that's what this does is it sort of makes the new rightmost element we want to consider one to the left of the current middle index. Which makes sense because if we just look at seven we want to go up to here right one to the left of the current middle index. And then the final case here is we're going to say else if if it's this case we know that the element is actually greater than the middle index. So else if the element is greater than the middle index we're going to consider the right hand side of the array. So we'll say return binary search a e and we'll say here mid plus one r. So what we're doing this time is we're effectively altering the left index when we call binary search. And we're saying we want to now look at the the right hand portion of the array or the right hand portion of this section of the array that we're looking at. And so here mid plus one if you consider this case here where we're looking at seven again maybe we're trying to find 12 right. So we're trying to find 12 we're looking at seven what we want to look at is this element here as the new leftmost element. The element one to the right of the current midpoint. And that's what that would give us is the leftmost element to look at would be now one to the right of the current middle element. So that's going to then cut up the problem for us like that. Continue looking at the left portion of the portion of the array we're looking at and the right portion of the current portion of the array we're looking at. Now the one thing we've got to look for is it's possible that the element is just not in the array at all. So if the element is just not in the array at all eventually what's going to happen is we would actually pass a left index that would actually be greater than the right index. That's what's going to eventually happen if we continue to follow this process. We're going to pass a left index into this function here that's going to be greater than the right index. If that ever happens we know we're done and we know that we just can't find the element in the array. So if that's the case here we'll say if the left index is greater than the right index we know we're done we just can't find it and we're going to return negative one. And negative one is going to be our special value to say that we just couldn't find it because negative one doesn't even make sense as an index right. Indexes have to go from zero one two three four five on up. So if we return negative one as the index we're basically saying we couldn't find it. So we'll try to call this function now and we'll try to store the index. We'll say int index is equal to binary search and we'll print it out. We'll say the index of 12 and we'll output that index. In this case the index of 12 should be 11 there again because arrays in C are zero indexed. So we'll give this a run here and we get the the index of 12 is 11 and it's worked. We give it another test here we could say the index of let's say three and we'll try to find three and the index of three should be two right because zero one two. So we'll save this give it a run and we get that the index of three is two and it seems to be working. We give it one more test here we could say what is the index of we'll say maybe 14 and we'll try to find 14. In this case we just shouldn't be able to find 14 and we should get back negative one. So run this here we get the index of 14 is negative one and so we've implemented the binary search algorithm in C.

RESPONSE: {
  "goal": "The main purpose of the video is to explain and implement the binary search algorithm in C, which efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.",
  "procedure": "The video begins by explaining the concept of binary search, highlighting its efficiency over linear search in sorted arrays. It then proceeds to implement the binary search algorithm in C, using a recursive function that takes an array, the target element, and left and right indices as arguments. The function calculates the midpoint, checks if the target is at the midpoint, and recursively narrows the search to the left or right half of the array based on comparisons. It also handles the case where the element is not found by returning -1.",
  "outcome": "The final outcome is a working implementation of the binary search algorithm in C, which correctly finds the index of a target element in a sorted array or returns -1 if the element is not present."

    "content": "Contents:\n```Welcome to TutorialsU, my name is Yannick and in this video we are going to talk about the binary search algorithm and we will take a look on how it is working in the background, so what exactly it is doing. So if you don't know the binary search algorithm yet, well, it's a very efficient way on how you can find an index of a specific value in an array or in a list, for example. So here we got an integer array and let's say we want to get the index of the value 6, so that would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right, and the binary search method, as you can call on an array, for example, when you just put in the array and the value you are searching for will then return the index, so let's see if I hit start, that should be, like, 5, as I said, let's give it a moment, the number 6 is at index 5, just as I said. So let's start thinking about what is happening in the background and why this is a very efficient way on how you can find specific values. We also got the content of the video written as a blog article at our website, you can find the link for that in the description below. We also provide an example of a custom binary search using a Person class there, very exciting, so check it out. Now, understanding this algorithm is quite simple, so if we have an array, we just need to make sure that it is sorted, so this is, well, at very first one of the big downsides of this binary search, the array or the list or whatever collection you want to use, it has to be sorted, so for sure we can use link to sort that array and afterwards we can then use the binary search. Now, if we compare that to a linear search, the binary search is definitely way more efficient and this is because the binary search algorithm only has to iterate through the array logarithmically. Now, what exactly is he doing when we try to find the value 6? So, basically, what he's going to do is, we have in total, we have 7 elements here, right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, so we have an odd number of elements. He goes exactly into the middle of the array, so that would be 4. We got 1, 2, 3 on the left side, 5, 6, 7 on the right side. Now, if we have an even number of elements, so let's say, let me just add one here, we got 8 now, well, what is the middle, right? The middle is like 4.5, so the value between 4 and 5 is 4.5, great, or 4.5, just to make it easier for you to understand. So, in that way, he would go to 4.5. Now, if we have that odd number, as I said, he would simply go to 4. Now, he will see, okay, is this my value? We are searching for 6, right? Keep that in mind. So, he will see, okay, the value that I got in the middle is 4, but I'm searching for 6. So, no, this is not my value. We now have a left side from that 4 position where we are, now we have a right side. Now, I don't want to make it too complex in that code editor, this is why I now open up some smaller images, just to make a better visual representation of all of that. So, here we got our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 array and keep in mind, we are searching for the value 6. As I said, he will now go into the middle of the array, which is 4, so we have a left side and a right side and he now checks, okay, is the middle value my desired value? No, but if it would be, the search would be completed, he would point to 6, he would say, all right, I immediately found the correct index. Now, 4 is smaller than 6, which basically means 6 is bigger, so he will go to the right side. If we would search for 2, he would go to the left side now. He would just perform that action again. So, let's say, okay, on the right side we got 5, 6, 7. Now, that chunk of the array will just, it will get repeated as it did before. Now, he will use that chunk of the array, 5, 6, 7, the right side from that middle outgoing and try to operate the same thing again. So, he will again take 5, 6, 7, go to the middle element and then we will have 5, 6, 7, as I said, and he will see, yes, that middle element this time is the correct one, right? So, he will say, yes, I found the correct element, I found the correct value and the index in that scenario is 5. So, this is basically what he's doing. He always goes to the next middle element. He takes the entire array, goes to the middle element, checks, is this the correct element? If yes, we're done. If not, is it bigger or smaller? If it's smaller, go to the left side. If it's bigger, go to the right side and this goes on and on and on and on until we found our element. So, right here, it's quite simple, right? Because we only have seven elements, but if we would have like a thousand, then this would be a lot of iterations. Great, and that's it already. So, this is how a binary search is working. Now, for all of you geeks out there, if you want to know it, the algorithm is super efficient because it has a time complexity of logarithmic, as I said it initially, in comparison to, let's say, a linear search, where we have O, N, where N is the size of the array. But in that case, we're going through the iterations or the iterations are passing through the array logarithmically and this is why it is more efficient. Now, if you want to gain more expert C Sharp knowledge, please check out our C Sharp Progress Academy, where you will learn full stack web development, including software design patterns in C Sharp and so much more. We offer a 14day moneyback guarantee, so you've got really nothing to lose. Check it out.

    "content": "Contents:\n```Welcome back, aliens! My name is Ravindra Reddy and let's continue with the series on Python. In the last video, we have worked on linear search, right? So, we were having a list and out of that list, we want to search for a particular element. So, if the element is there, it will say found and it will also show the location, right, or the position of it. If the element is not there, it will simply print not found. So, linear search is good, right? But then what if you have a list of, let's say, 1000 values and the value which you're searching for is on, let's say, after 800 values. So, you're wasting so much of time. So, as your list length increases, it will increase the time as well. So, do we have a better way? And yes, we have one more search technique, which is a binary search. How that works? So, before continuing with binary search, you have to understand in binary search, all the values have to be sorted, okay? So, normally, when you work with linear search, it's not compulsory to have the values sorted, we can have values in any order. But in case of binary search, you have to make sure that your values are sorted. That means if I provide initial values, example, we are putting values like this, right? So, we will change it, we will have a value which is sorted, right? So, let's say 4, 7, 8, 12, 45, 99. So, let's say we have this value. So, we have six values, I want to search for a particular value. So, instead of going for a linear search here, we will go for binary search. Now, how that works? So, let's imagine we have a list here, right? And if you want to search for an element, what you will do is you will first specify the lower bound and the upper bound, okay? So, as you can see, the first value is a lower bound here. So, the first value itself is a lower bound. And the last value is the upper bound. You can say first or last, but then let's go with this word L or U. So, L is the first index and U is the last index. Once you have assigned this thing, the next step you have to do is you have to find a midindex. Now, how do you find a midindex? As names suggest mid, it should be a midpoint of this lower and upper, right? So, you will simply say lower plus upper divided by two, you will get midvalue. Now, whenever you say midvalue, so in this case, you can see we got the midvalue there, right? So, the element, let's say, okay, so before going ahead, let me find element, let's specify the element. I want to search 45, okay? So, if you want to search 45, so you can see we got the midvalue, right? So, what's the midvalue? So, the index value for 4 is 0. The index value for 99 is 5. So, 0 plus 5 is 5 and 5 divided by 2 is 2, right? So, we are doing integer division here, right? We are not doing float division. So, we are doing int division. So, it will give you 2. So, the value at index value 2, so basically our mid is 2 now. So, the value at that index is 8, right? So, now we got 8 as the midvalue. The next step is you have to check the midvalue which you have got is matching with the element which you're searching for. The element we are searching for is 45, right? So, it's not matching. Now, the next step would be you have to change your lower bound or upper bound. For the next iteration, you have to change your lower bound or upper bound. Now, which one to change? For this, you have to check the value you're searching for is smaller or bigger than the midvalue. If the value is smaller, change your upper bound. That means you will simply say the midvalue is the new upper bound. If your value is greater than the midvalue, so the midvalue here is 8, right? And the value which you are searching for is 45. So, now you have to change your lower bound. So, what you will do is, so the old lower bound, now it will shift to the midvalue. So, your m becomes l, right? So, instead of having a big list, now you got a small list, right? So, the list start with 8 and it ends at 99. Now, you got a new lower and the upper value. So, what you will do, you will again find the midvalue. So, that's what you do every time. So, your lower plus upper. So, what is your lower? Lower is basically 2 and your upper is 5. 2 plus 5 is 7. 7 divided by 2 is 3, right? So, now 12 becomes your new midvalue. Is it matching? Again, the same thing. It's not matching, right? We are searching for 45. Now, you have to change your lower value again because 45 is bigger than 12. So, you will shift your lower value to 12 now. So, your 12 is the lower value and 99 is the upper value. So, what you will do now is you will simply say mid again. The lower value is 3. The upper value is 5. So, mid becomes 4 and at 4, we have 45, right? So, now you will check and you got the value. Now, you might be thinking, oh, is it a good way of doing that? And the answer is yes because in the initial level, you are skipping some values. You are not checking all the values. If your list is big, it will skip a lot of values which you are not checking, okay? So, it will improve the speed as well. The only thing is you have to, the values which you are taking should be sorted. Let's implement this with the code now. So, what we are going to do is let's keep the same code. We have the list of values here. Let's search for 45. And so, we are saying search, list. We are passing the list. We are passing n. But we have to change something, right? We have to change the logic here. So, let me just remove the entire stuff. This is something which will change, right? Now, the first thing is you have to mention the lower bound, upper bound, right? So, you will say l is equal to 0. So, you will always start l with 0. And you will say u which is the upper bound. So, l is lower bound, u is upper bound. Upper bound will be the length of the added, right? So, you will say length of the least minus 1 because it should be 1 less than this term. Now, once you got the lower and upper, let's apply a loop. This time, again, I will go with a while loop. Now, till what point you have to reach there? So, you have to stop at two scenarios. One, the moment you found the value. And second, your lower bound should not be greater than upper bound, okay? If that happens, you have to stop it. So, your lower bound should be always less than or equal to the upper bound, okay? It should be less than or equal to, okay? It should not be greater than equal to. And then you have to also stop at the moment you find the value, right? So, let's do that later. So, in this while, you have to find the mid value now, right? So, once we got lower, once we got upper, every time you have to find the mid value. So, you will take mid is equal to, how do you find mid? It's lower plus upper by 2, right? So, you will say lower plus upper. And if you say divided by 2, so you will keep that in bracket. Now, you want an integer division, right? You don't want a normal division. So, you will use double slash which we have done before. Double slash will give you integer division and you got mid value. Now, you will check if the mid value, so mid index. So, we have to find the value for the mid index, right? And the way you do that is by saying list of mid. If this is matching with the value which you're searching for which is n, our job is done, right? You will simply print found. In fact, I also want to mention the position, right? So, you will say pause is equal to mid because that's the position you were looking for. Oh, but pause becomes a local variable, right? So, let's make it global variable here. We are saving that position as well. And then you have to do one more thing. We simply have to say break, right? That's very important or we can simply say return true. Why I'm using semicolon everywhere. That's it. Once you got the value, you will simply return true. Otherwise, what if the value is not there? So, you will go for else. If the value is not matching in else, you have to do some extra stuff which is you have to say if. Now, you have to change your lower bound, upper bound, right? Because if you remember, if your mid value is not matching with the value which you're searching for, you have to change your lower bound or the upper bound. Which one to change? Depending upon the value is greater than the mid value or smaller than the mid value. So, you will check list of mid is smaller. If it is smaller than the mid value, you have to go, you have to change your upper bound, right? So, you will say if that is smaller than the value which you're searching for, which is n, change the lower bound. And in the other case, you have to change the upper bound. Now, let's see if that works. I feel something is wrong, but let's verify. So, what I will do is I will simply run this code. It works. You can see that it says found at 5. Is it right? 4, 7, 8, 12 and 5. 45. That's great, right? And let me just do it for some other value now. Let's say maybe 7. And you can see if you're searching for 7, it will still work. You can see it says 2. And if you have a bigger list as well, let me just add some more values to here. So, it doesn't matter how big value you're searching for. And let me search for 1, 0, 9, 8, 7. The moment you search for this, around this, you can see it says at 9 position. Is it right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. That's great. So, this is how you do a binary search. So, just to repeat, just to reiterate what we are doing here is, so, we got the lower bound, we got the upper bound, and then you are finding the mid value. So, mid value is basically the addition of lower bound, upper bound divided by 2, okay? Now, once you've got the mid value, you have to compare that mid value with the value which you're searching for. If it is matching, that's great. So, if it is not matching, in that scenario, you will again find a new mid value. But before finding a new mid value, you have to change your lower bound or the upper bound. So, because you have to reduce the size of the array or the list, right? So, depending upon is it belongs to right hand side or left hand side, you will change it. So, that's how it works. But then we have not done for something which is not there. Example, if I search for 10, and you can see we don't have 10. It should print not found, right? It is not printing anything. So, at the end here, you have to return false. Because ultimately, you're working with true and false. And don't use semicolon because I work on the languages which use semicolon there. Let's ignore that. Oh, it's still not working. It's still not says not found. Is it we have to do plus one? So, for the lower bound, you have to shift to the mid plus one for the upper bound. Because see, if mid is not available, then why you have to even check for mid now, right? Mid is done. So, you have to say L is equal to mid plus one. But for upper bound, you have to say minus one, because you have to skip that mid value, right? I guess that's the issue. Let's run this code. Oh, you can see it says not found. That's great. So, we got the output. This is how you do one is search. Okay. So, watch this video once again and do practice. That's how you will improve your skills. So, I hope you are enjoying this video. Let me know in the comment section and do subscribe for further videos.```"

RESPONSE: {
  "goal": "The main purpose of the video is to teach viewers how to implement binary search in Python, which is a more efficient search technique compared to linear search, especially for large sorted lists.",
  "procedure": "The video explains the binary search algorithm, starting with the requirement that the list must be sorted. It then describes setting initial lower and upper bounds, calculating the mid index, and comparing the mid value with the target. Depending on the comparison, the bounds are adjusted to narrow the search range. This process repeats until the target is found or the bounds overlap, indicating the target is not present. The video also includes a coding demonstration of this logic in Python.",
  "outcome": "By the end of the video, viewers should understand how to implement binary search in Python and see it successfully locate elements in a sorted list, or return 'not found' if the element is absent."
