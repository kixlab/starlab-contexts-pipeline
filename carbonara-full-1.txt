Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze."

Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares. Now let's just fix that. Breaking spaghetti in half is a crime in Italy and can land you in prison for up to nine months. It sounds like an overreaction at first, but the crack sends a shock wave through the noodle, rendering it completely inedible. I mean look, here's uncracked spaghetti and cracked spaghetti.

The process is filled with comedic commentary and intentional deviations from traditional Carbonara methods.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `Grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling.`; `Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti.`; `Now our bacon is cooked.`; `Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation.`; `Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a dish that humorously resembles Pasta Carbonara but is intentionally not authentic, as it uses bacon instead of guanciale and includes comedic elements like adding peas.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`And here we don't have carbonara.`; `I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetable free.`\n"

Too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great. So are the whims of the food gods. If this was carbonara, you'd have to be careful, because the carbonistic properties are so fragile that if you put in a single pea, it would no longer be carbonara. It's a mysterious chemical reaction that only Italian scientists understand. I'm craving carbonara, but I don't have guanciale. Should I really even bother? Oh no, will they judge my carbonara?

I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in."

The cooked pasta is then combined with the bacon, its fat, and the cheese-egg mixture off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God.

        "text": "And as a chef, grating your own cheese is super important. For my carbonara, I choose to use two cheeses. I'm using Parmesan cheese and I'm using Pecorino. And I do buy the good stuff for this. I go to the Italian cheeses. If you can get it, go for the best cheese you can find. I like to use a microplane for this. Now, a microplane is a very fine grater. When this cheese melts, I want it to be nice and fine. I don't wanna get shreds in there. I wanna get this beautiful, fine cheese that's gonna make my sauce super silky in the end. What I like about using two cheeses here is the Parmesan gives me a nice nuttiness and it gives me a really great kind of earthy flavor, whereas the Pecorino is super sharp and it's got a lot of bite to it. So look, I have a lot of cheese here and that's a good thing. That's what I want. So this is for about four servings. Now that my cheese is grated, I can get to my eggs. For carbonara, I like my eggs to be room temperature. So what I'll do is I'll set them on the counter for about a half hour before I make the dish. Because if they're cold, that's gonna slow everything down. I'm gonna put hot pasta and cold eggs and the dish isn't gonna come together and emulsify right. So eggs are the binder for this dish. This is what brings the whole thing together. And I'm going to use three whole eggs and two egg yolks. And what I like to do is crack my egg in half and just run my yolk between the shells until the white all runs out all the way. A lot of times people will just use straight eggs for this and that's okay, but the yolk is a lot of fat and the white is a lot of liquid. So by adding the extra yolk, I'm adding more fat to the dish, more richness to the dish. The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix my eggs and cheese together. And this is a really important step because I want this to be a smooth and creamy sauce around my pasta. We wanna get this into a nice homogenous mixture so that when we actually add the pasta to it, we don't get scrambled eggs. Not a good look for carbonara. All right, so let's just take the cheese, dump it into the eggs and we can just get this together. And you'll see, it's gonna get kind of like a thick, creamy mixture. Get that all in there. I use a whisk just to get this together, but I'm not gonna use a whisk past this point. But you can see, the mixture looks nice and creamy. It's come together. There's no bits of eggs or bits of cheese that aren't mixed in. And that's what I want. This is super important getting your carbonara to the right finished texture. At this point, I wanna add a little bit of my toasted black peppercorns, right? Give it a shake. Get a little bit of your finely ground stuff. Get a little bit of your bigger chunks. So my egg and cheese mixture is ready to go."

Pasta's gonna take about 10 minutes, and in that time, I'm going to get my guanciale ready to go. So turn your heat on. I like to use a little olive oil in my pan before I start cooking my guanciale. People will say, but Chef Frank, the guanciale has a lot of fat. I like to put this in the pan to get the process going quicker. My guanciale is gonna brown a little more evenly. I don't really have to wait for that fat to render out. So a little bit of fat in my pan to start is the way that I always go. We're gonna cook this until it is light golden brown. You can hear it start to sizzle. I don't want this to be crisp. I want it to have some chew to it in the end. So we're not gonna brown it all the way. We want to keep all the fat. A lot of people say, whoa, that's a lot of fat. We're gonna put that in the pasta? Yes, we're using all the fat. The fat is key to this dish. It's also going to emulsify with the egg yolks and make this sauce super creamy. Don't forget to get in there and stir your pasta occasionally. We don't want it sticking. Well, how do you tell if pasta's done? If you look at it right now, it's still very firm, right? We want it to be nice and al dente, which means to the tooth. We don't want it to be overcooked. We want it to have a little bite to it. My guanciale is ready to go. You can see it's still bubbling away. It's not completely done, but if I leave it in the pan and keep it hot, it's gonna continue to cook. I don't want it to get any more crisp than this. So I think my pasta is ready. The best way to determine if it is, is to take a piece, try not to burn yourself, and actually taste it. And that's good to go."

        "text": "- **Overall Goal**: The main purpose of the video is to teach viewers how to make traditional Pasta Carbonara correctly, using accessible ingredients like bacon instead of guanciale, and emphasizing the simplicity of the dish without unnecessary additions like cream.\n\t- **Overall Goal Quotes**:`Today, hang out for a second, and you're gonna learn how to do it right.`; `It's so simple!`; `You need to understand, carbonara does not need cream, or peas, or ham, or whatever else people are putting in it.`\n- **Overall Procedure**: The process involves preparing the bacon by rendering its fat, cooking the pasta, and creating a cheese and egg mixture. The cooked pasta is then combined with the bacon, its fat, and the cheese-egg mixture off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God. Looks so good.`; `And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.`; `Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man.`; `And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch.`\n"

The cooked pasta is then combined with the bacon, its fat, and the cheese-egg mixture off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God.

Add toasted black peppercorns.\n\t- **Instructions Quotes**:`Grating your own cheese is super important.`; `I like to use a microplane for this.`; `For carbonara, I like my eggs to be room temperature.`; `I'm going to use three whole eggs and two egg yolks.`; `The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix my eggs and cheese together.`; `Let's just take the cheese, dump it into the eggs and we can just get this together.`; `At this point, I wanna add a little bit of my toasted black peppercorns.`\n- **Rationale**: Grating cheese finely ensures it melts smoothly for a silky sauce.

Mixing eggs and cheese prevents scrambled eggs in the sauce.\n\t- **Rationale Quotes**:`When this cheese melts, I want it to be nice and fine.`; `If they're cold, that's gonna slow everything down.`; `The yolk is a lot of fat and the white is a lot of liquid.`; `By adding the extra yolk, I'm adding more fat to the dish, more richness to the dish.`; `We wanna get this into a nice homogenous mixture so that when we actually add the pasta to it, we don't get scrambled eggs.`\n- **Tips**: Use the best quality cheese you can find for better flavor.

The process is filled with comedic commentary and intentional deviations from traditional Carbonara methods.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `Grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling.`; `Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti.`; `Now our bacon is cooked.`; `Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation.`; `Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a dish that humorously resembles Pasta Carbonara but is intentionally not authentic, as it uses bacon instead of guanciale and includes comedic elements like adding peas.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`And here we don't have carbonara.`; `I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetable free.`\n"

The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God. Looks so good.`; `And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.`; `Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man.`; `And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch.`\n"

Combine the cooked pasta with the bacon fat and cheese-egg mixture off the heat. 2. Gently mix to avoid breaking the pasta and scrambling the eggs. 3. If needed, use reserved pasta water to adjust the sauce consistency.\n\t- ** Rationale**: The heat from the pasta gently cooks the eggs, creating a creamy sauce without scrambling them. Using pasta water helps adjust the sauce consistency.\n\t- ** Tips**: If the sauce doesn't thicken as desired, place the pan over the pasta water to gently heat it like a bain-marie. Use pasta water to loosen the sauce if it's too thick.\n\t- ** Outcome**: A creamy, velvety sauce coats the pasta without scrambling the eggs.\n"

Set eggs to room temperature. Crack three whole eggs and two yolks, separating whites. Mix eggs and cheese to a homogenous mixture. Add toasted black peppercorns.\n\t- **Instructions Quotes**:`Grating your own cheese is super important.`; `I like to use a microplane for this.`; `For carbonara, I like my eggs to be room temperature.`; `I'm going to use three whole eggs and two egg yolks.`; `The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix my eggs and cheese together.`; `Let's just take the cheese, dump it into the eggs and we can just get this together.`; `At this point, I wanna add a little bit of my toasted black peppercorns.`\n- **Rationale**: Grating cheese finely ensures it melts smoothly for a silky sauce. Room temperature eggs help emulsify the sauce properly. Extra yolks add richness. Mixing eggs and cheese prevents scrambled eggs in the sauce.\n\t- **Rationale Quotes**:`When this cheese melts, I want it to be nice and fine.`; `If they're cold, that's gonna slow everything down.`; `The yolk is a lot of fat and the white is a lot of liquid.`; `By adding the extra yolk, I'm adding more fat to the dish, more richness to the dish.`; `We wanna get this into a nice homogenous mixture so that when we actually add the pasta to it, we don't get scrambled eggs.`\n- **Tips**: Use the best quality cheese you can find for better flavor. Use a microplane for fine grating. Let eggs sit out for half an hour to reach room temperature.\n\t- **Tips Quotes**:`If you can get it, go for the best cheese you can find.`; `I like to use a microplane for this.`; `For carbonara, I like my eggs to be room temperature.`; `I'll set them on the counter for about a half hour before I make the dish.`\n- **Outcome**: A smooth and creamy egg and cheese mixture ready for making carbonara.\n\t- **Outcome Quotes**:`The mixture looks nice and creamy.`; `It's come together.`; `There's no bits of eggs or bits of cheese that aren't mixed in.`; `This is super important getting your carbonara to the right finished texture.`\n"

Looks so good.`; `And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.`; `Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man.`; `And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch.`\n"

The process is filled with comedic commentary and intentional deviations from traditional Carbonara methods.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`The first thing we're gonna do is chop up some bacon.`; `Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making.`; `Grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling.`; `Now we'll salt this angry water, then throw in 156 pieces of spaghetti.`; `Now our bacon is cooked.`; `Noodles go straight from the water into the bacon pan for a wang jangulation.`; `Then the sauce can go in and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a dish that humorously resembles Pasta Carbonara but is intentionally not authentic, as it uses bacon instead of guanciale and includes comedic elements like adding peas.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`And here we don't have carbonara.`; `I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetable free.`\n"

Add the egg mixture once the sauce is creamy.\n\t- ** Rationale**: The combination of pasta water and guanciale fat creates a creamy sauce through emulsification, which is essential for the texture of carbonara.\n\t- ** Tips**: Ensure the heat is off before adding the egg mixture to prevent scrambling. Use pasta water to control the sauce's consistency.\n\t- ** Outcome**: A creamy sauce is formed by emulsifying pasta water with guanciale fat, ready to be combined with the egg mixture.\n"

The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God.

The cooked pasta is then combined with the bacon, its fat, and the cheese-egg mixture off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God. Looks so good.`; `And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.`; `Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man.`; `And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch.`\n"

Once crispy, remove some bacon for garnish and drain on a paper towel. 6. Turn off the heat and drain most of the fat, leaving about two tablespoons in the pan.\n\t- ** Rationale**: Rendering the fat slowly ensures the bacon becomes crispy without burning, and the fat is used to flavor the pasta.\n\t- ** Tips**: Do not add olive oil to the pasta; it's a myth that it helps. Use affordable pasta brands as they work well.\n\t- ** Outcome**: Crispy bacon with rendered fat, some reserved for garnish and some for the pasta.\n"

Toss the pasta, adding more liquid as needed to create a creamy sauce. 5.

Retaining guanciale fat is crucial for emulsifying with egg yolks to create a creamy sauce.\n\t- ** Tips**: Taste pasta to ensure it's al dente. Avoid overcooking guanciale to keep it chewy.\n\t- ** Outcome**: Cooked al dente pasta and browned guanciale with retained fat for sauce.\n"

The cooked pasta is then combined with the bacon, its fat, and the cheese-egg mixture off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God. Looks so good.`; `And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.`; `Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man.`; `And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch.`\n"

The cooked pasta is then combined with the bacon, its fat, and the cheese-egg mixture off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God.

The cooked pasta is then combined with the bacon, its fat, and the cheese-egg mixture off the heat to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. The dish is finished with additional cheese and crispy bacon as garnish.\n\t- **Overall Procedure Quotes**:`Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured.`; `So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `Now, bacon is rendering, pasta water is coming up to a boil, and we're gonna season our pasta water just a little bit.`; `So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.`; `Now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.`; `The eggs are going to cook from the heat of this pasta and very gently and beautifully in a velvety, fluffy, creamy way, coat it all up, right?`; `And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.`\n- **Overall Outcome**: The final outcome is a creamy, velvety Pasta Carbonara with a rich flavor from the cheese and bacon, topped with crispy bacon for added texture.\n\t- **Overall Outcome Quotes**:`Oh, my God. Looks so good.`; `And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.`; `Just get it off the tongs like so. Oh, man.`; `And of course, some of your crispy bacon. Just for an added crunch.`\n"
