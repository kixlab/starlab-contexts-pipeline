Ensure all ingredients are fresh and ready for use. Optionally, prepare tools like a cheese grater and pepper grinder.\n\t- Dependencies: \n- **Subgoal 2**:\n\t- Title: Cook Pasta\n\t- Definition: Boil water in a large pot, add salt, and cook the pasta until it is al dente. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Reserve some pasta water before draining.\n\t- Dependencies: Prepare Ingredients\n- **Subgoal 3**:\n\t- Title: Cook Meat\n\t- Definition: Cut the guanciale, pancetta, or bacon into small pieces. Cook it in a pan over medium heat until it is crispy and the fat is rendered. Optionally, start with a cold pan to render fat slowly. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Optionally, reserve some cooked meat for garnish.\n\t- Dependencies: Prepare Ingredients\n- **Subgoal 4**:\n\t- Title: Mix Sauce\n\t- Definition: In a bowl, combine egg yolks (or a combination of whole eggs and yolks) with grated pecorino romano cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Mix until smooth. Optionally, add Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Add a small amount of reserved pasta water to achieve a creamy consistency.\n\t- Dependencies: Prepare Ingredients\n- **Subgoal 5**:\n\t- Title: Combine Ingredients\n\t- Definition: Add the cooked pasta directly to the pan with the cooked meat. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta and meat, stirring quickly to coat the pasta without scrambling the eggs. Use the residual heat to cook the eggs gently. Add more pasta water if needed to create a creamy sauce.\n\t- Dependencies: Cook Pasta, Cook Meat, Mix Sauce\n- **Subgoal 6**:\n\t- Title: Finish Dish\n\t- Definition: Plate the Pasta Carbonara, ensuring it is evenly coated with the sauce. Finish with additional grated cheese and black pepper to taste before serving. Optionally, add reserved crispy meat as garnish.\n\t- Dependencies: Combine Ingredients\n"

        "text": "Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged. I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese. Okay, now time for the eggs. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks. I like to do a mixture of both. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks. The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture. And you'll see all that, and it looked like so much cheese, right? But as this breaks down, it won't look like that anymore. Add that all in. And so now we have a consistency like this. Now, this is a very important time for our good friend, Sergeant Gilbert. I'm gonna put quite a bit of Gilbert's insides into this egg mixture. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020. You know, and this is preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in."

Ensure all ingredients are fresh and ready for use. Optionally, prepare tools like a cheese grater and pepper grinder.\n\t- Dependencies: \n- **Subgoal 2**:\n\t- Title: Cook Pasta\n\t- Definition: Boil water in a large pot, add salt, and cook the pasta until it is al dente. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Reserve some pasta water before draining.\n\t- Dependencies: Prepare Ingredients\n- **Subgoal 3**:\n\t- Title: Cook Meat\n\t- Definition: Cut the guanciale, pancetta, or bacon into small pieces. Cook it in a pan over medium heat until it is crispy and the fat is rendered. Optionally, start with a cold pan to render fat slowly. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Optionally, reserve some cooked meat for garnish.\n\t- Dependencies: Prepare Ingredients\n- **Subgoal 4**:\n\t- Title: Mix Sauce\n\t- Definition: In a bowl, combine egg yolks (or a combination of whole eggs and yolks) with grated pecorino romano cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Mix until smooth. Optionally, add Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Add a small amount of reserved pasta water to achieve a creamy consistency.\n\t- Dependencies: Prepare Ingredients\n- **Subgoal 5**:\n\t- Title: Combine Ingredients\n\t- Definition: Add the cooked pasta directly to the pan with the cooked meat. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta and meat, stirring quickly to coat the pasta without scrambling the eggs. Use the residual heat to cook the eggs gently. Add more pasta water if needed to create a creamy sauce.\n\t- Dependencies: Cook Pasta, Cook Meat, Mix Sauce\n- **Subgoal 6**:\n\t- Title: Finish Dish\n\t- Definition: Plate the Pasta Carbonara, ensuring it is evenly coated with the sauce. Finish with additional grated cheese and black pepper to taste before serving. Optionally, add reserved crispy meat as garnish.\n\t- Dependencies: Combine Ingredients\n"

I like to do a mixture of both.`\n\t- **Materials**: Bacon, Pecorino Romano cheese, Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, eggs, black pepper, cheese grater, pepper grinder.\n\t- **Materials Quotes**:`So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.`; `And thickcut bacon would be best.`; `Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged.`; `That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.`; `So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater.`; `Okay, now time for the eggs.`; `If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper. He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020.`\n\t- **Outcome**: Prepared ingredients including sliced bacon, grated cheese, and mixed egg and cheese mixture with pepper.\n\t- **Outcome Quotes**:`So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `So here's all our beautiful cheese.`; `And so now we have a consistency like this.`; `Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.`\n\t- **Instructions**: 1. Slice about a half pound of thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces. 2. Grate three ounces each of Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. 3. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl. 4. Whisk the grated cheese into the egg mixture. 5. Add ground black pepper to taste and whisk it in.\n\t- **Instructions Quotes**:`So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half.`; `Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.`; `Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.`\n\t- **Rationale**: Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible to an American audience. Mixing whole eggs and yolks balances richness without being overwhelming.\n\t- **Rationale Quotes**:`So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.`; `The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.`\n\t- **Tips**: Use thick-cut bacon for better texture. Ensure Parmigiano Reggiano is authentic by checking it is from Italy. Adjust pepper to personal taste.\n\t- **Tips Quotes**:`And thickcut bacon would be best.`; `That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.`; `Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.`\n"

He's a sentient being, a pepper grinder, who became selfaware in 2020.`\n\t- **Outcome**: Prepared ingredients including sliced bacon, grated cheese, and mixed egg and cheese mixture with pepper.\n\t- **Outcome Quotes**:`So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `So here's all our beautiful cheese.`; `And so now we have a consistency like this.`; `Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.`\n\t- **Instructions**: 1. Slice about a half pound of thick-cut bacon into three-quarter inch pieces. 2. Grate three ounces each of Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. 3. Mix three whole eggs and two egg yolks in a bowl. 4. Whisk the grated cheese into the egg mixture. 5. Add ground black pepper to taste and whisk it in.\n\t- **Instructions Quotes**:`So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half.`; `Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.`; `Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.`\n\t- **Rationale**: Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible to an American audience. Mixing whole eggs and yolks balances richness without being overwhelming.\n\t- **Rationale Quotes**:`So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.`; `The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.`\n\t- **Tips**: Use thick-cut bacon for better texture.

Add ground black pepper to taste and whisk it in.\n\t- **Instructions Quotes**:`So I'll take about a half pound of bacon, and we're gonna slice this just pretty thick, this way.`; `I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half.`; `Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.`; `Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.`\n\t- **Rationale**: Using bacon instead of guanciale makes the recipe more accessible to an American audience. Mixing whole eggs and yolks balances richness without being overwhelming.\n\t- **Rationale Quotes**:`So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon.`; `The way I see it, carbonara is already so rich, it doesn't need all egg yolks.`\n\t- **Tips**: Use thick-cut bacon for better texture. Ensure Parmigiano Reggiano is authentic by checking it is from Italy. Adjust pepper to personal taste.\n\t- **Tips Quotes**:`And thickcut bacon would be best.`; `That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff.`; `Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.`\n"

Drop that in there.`\n\t- **Rationale**: Less salt is added to the pasta water because carbonara has many salty elements.\n\t- **Rationale Quotes**:`Usually, I'm gonna put more salt, but because there's so many salty elements in carbonara, I wanna put less salt in the pasta water.`\n\t- **Tips**: Leave the pasta water in the pot as it will be needed later.\n\t- **Tips Quotes**:`you want to leave this water in this pot.

Cracking the peppercorns and sieving them ensures a hotter, more intense flavor, which is ideal for carbonara.\n\t- **Rationale Quotes**:`The reason I want it cold is because I want to render the fat out.`; `Honestly, this is the outer skin. This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter. Perfect for a good hot carbonara.`\n\t- **Tips**: Use a cold pan to start rendering the fat slowly.

That's how you know this isn't carbonara, because if you were making carbonara, you'd be using guanciale. You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.\n"

See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style. Sadly, these days you can only find straight parallel line spaghetti. And you know, it just really angers me that the craft has been left to die like nobody cares.\n"

The guanciale goes in to the pan and this pan is getting hot. Give the garlic a crack and then put it in the pan. As this starts to sizzle, the fat will just pull out some of that perfume from the garlic. Then there's the black pepper. Get your peppercorns in a pestle and mortar. Crack it. Get a little sieve. This is one of the most important little bits and no one really does it, okay. Honestly, this is the outer skin. This is much milder. What we have here is the inside part, the peppercorn, which is hotter. Perfect for a good hot carbonara. The guanciale is getting golden.\n"

You see, bacon comes from a pig, whereas guanciale comes from a completely different animal, known as an Italian hog. Oh my god, it looks like a jumping Italian horse! You wouldn't make a hamburger with tiger meat, would you? I really hope not. Tigers are expensive. Carbonara is typically made with egg yolks, which is irrelevant, since that's not what we're making. Don't accidentally use egg yolkles, because banjo music really ruins this dish. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick. You can also do the back and forth, and whoops, maybe no forth. Then make the traditional Italian egg white on toast as an appetizer. Mmm. This is pecorino romano, which you would use if you're making carbonara, which we are not. It gets its name because the Romans who made it had huge pecs. So did the goats. They worked out together. If you want to shred your pecorino more easily, you can take a drill, put in a nice big fat screw, then you just... okay. So, whoop. All right. If I just maybe... okay, let's try. Nope. See, in my mind when I thought of this, none of the physics of how objects work would be an issue. If you're Italian, you don't need to innovate in this department, because you simply harness the power of your hand gesture muscles, which makes this a breeze. So grate that into the egg yolk and wang jangle until you've got Cadbury cream egg filling. Then we'll add some pepper pepper pepper, and we're good to go. And by go, I mean stay, because we're not done yet. The original carbonara was made with handcrafted artisan spaghetti from the Veneto region. Each spaghetti craftsperson had their signature style.
