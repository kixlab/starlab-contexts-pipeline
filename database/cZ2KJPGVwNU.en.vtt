00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.374
Today on The Stay At Home Chef

00:00:01.374 --> 00:00:04.263
I'm showing you my&nbsp;master muffin recipe.

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:07.726
Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins,

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:12.907
today I'm sharing my master muffin recipe, 
which you can use to make almost any flavor,

00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:14.478
and it's super easy.

00:00:14.478 --> 00:00:18.454
Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:23.040
Then line&nbsp;a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.391
Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick&nbsp;cooking spray, 
right on those paper baking cups,

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:30.520
to prevent the muffins from sticking.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.547
Now&nbsp;it's time to put together our batter.

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:38.121
First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter,&nbsp;
and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.395
each demonstrating a different&nbsp;way 
that you can build upon the base recipe.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.659
The batter starts with 1/2 cup of softened salted butter,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.056
and 1 cup of granulated sugar.

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:50.903
We're going&nbsp;to use a hand mixer to cream this together.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.347
At first this mixture will be lumpy, 
but keep on&nbsp;mixing for about 2 minutes.

00:00:56.347 --> 00:01:03.132
After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, 
and&nbsp;it'll be a smooth, paste-like, creamy consistency.

00:01:03.132 --> 00:01:07.970
Then you'll add in 2 large eggs, 
and mix this&nbsp;briefly until just combined,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.233
about 30 seconds.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.320
Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla&nbsp;extract, 
or you can use other flavors of extract,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.910
like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.319
Those are all super popular options.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.976
For the lemon and citrus extracts 
I recommend only using 1/2 teaspoon of those,

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:30.171
and combining that with 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:33.381
You'll also need 2&nbsp;teaspoons of baking powder,

00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.233
and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:41.453
This is also the point where you'd add in any&nbsp;spices 
like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.

00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:45.978
We're gonna give this a quick mix just to combine, 
about&nbsp;10 seconds.

00:01:45.978 --> 00:01:51.072
Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer 
and grab a rubber spatula.

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:53.037
Add in&nbsp;half of your all-purpose flour.

00:01:53.037 --> 00:01:56.831
You're going to use 2 cups total, 
so you're going to add in&nbsp;1 cup right now.

00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.837
Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.

00:01:59.837 --> 00:02:05.879
Once all those white specks of&nbsp;flour start to disappear, 
you'll pour in 1/2 cup of either milk or buttermilk.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.177
Buttermilk is&nbsp;going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin.

00:02:09.177 --> 00:02:13.133
And you'll stir this in as well until it's well&nbsp;combined.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:17.262
Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour.

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:22.571
Stir this together scraping&nbsp;the sides and bottom of the bowl 
to ensure that everything gets mixed in.

00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:27.278
Now if you're gonna&nbsp;add anything into your muffins, 
like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries,

00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:28.961
now would be the time&nbsp;to do so.

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.850
but I'll show you that in just a minute.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.810
Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.658
We're gonna divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, 
and you should fill each one about&nbsp;2/3 of the way full.

00:02:40.658 --> 00:02:47.920
It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2/3 or what's 3/4, 
so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.801
because this does make 12&nbsp;muffins.

00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:54.887
You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes 
before popping it in the oven,

00:02:54.887 --> 00:03:01.036
or if you're making a larger batch it's totally okay to let it 
rest in between cooking different&nbsp;batches.

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:05.444
Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.

00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:11.827
After 7 minutes reduce the&nbsp;temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.

00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:15.650
Continue baking for 12-15 minutes, 
and watch them carefully,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.099
as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your&nbsp;oven.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.128
Now let's start going over some variations, 
starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.

00:03:24.128 --> 00:03:30.000
This is&nbsp;great because it demonstrates both using 
another flavor of extract as well as adding in fresh fruit.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.543
I've already creamed together the sugar and butter 
and added in the eggs,

00:03:33.543 --> 00:03:36.316
so now I'm going to add&nbsp;in 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract,

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:41.412
and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract 
before adding in my&nbsp;baking powder and salt.

00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:45.818
Continue on with the rest of the recipe 
adding in the flour and buttermilk.

00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:50.413
Once you have your batter finished 
you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries,

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:52.938
or frozen even, 
you&nbsp;can use those too.

00:03:52.938 --> 00:03:59.853
Then this is optional but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, 
so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.

00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:02.576
Then simply fold this in.

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:08.334
Then it's just a matter of once again dividing&nbsp;the batter evenly 
amongst the 12 muffin cups.

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:15.307
One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling&nbsp;on about 
1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.

00:04:15.307 --> 00:04:20.614
This gives it a nice little crunchy&nbsp;sweet top, 
and then of course bake these just as we did before.

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:23.728
Next up i'm going to show you how to&nbsp;make a chocolate version.

00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:27.553
For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again 
just like&nbsp;before,

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:32.899
but this time you'll add in 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, 
unsweetened cocoa powder,

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.845
and cream&nbsp;that in with it.

00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:39.370
From here you'll proceed with the rest of the 
master muffin recipe by adding in eggs,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.056
baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, 
and milk or buttermilk.

00:04:44.056 --> 00:04:49.589
The addition of the&nbsp;cocoa powder really doesn't do much 
to change the texture of the final batter.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.444
Then just for&nbsp;fun i'm going to add in 
1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips,

00:04:53.444 --> 00:04:55.277
and fold those in.

00:04:55.277 --> 00:05:00.000
Even though&nbsp;you can mix and match add-ins, 
you want to total any additions that you make,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.125
like chocolate chips,&nbsp;or nuts, or dried fruit, 
to 1 cup total.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.843
Next i'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin&nbsp;hacks

00:05:06.843 --> 00:05:12.748
that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors 
by using instant pudding.

00:05:12.748 --> 00:05:17.173
This&nbsp;time you're only going to add in 3/4 cup of granulated sugar,

00:05:17.173 --> 00:05:24.492
because you're going&nbsp;to replace that additional 1/4 cup 
with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix,

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:28.472
and this&nbsp;time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.

00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:33.520
Cream this together and then&nbsp;proceed with 
the master muffin recipe as directed.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.706
You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if&nbsp;you wanted.

00:05:37.706 --> 00:05:42.751
This variation is fun because there's just 
so many different flavors of instant&nbsp;pudding out there.

00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:49.106
It makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly&nbsp;
without having to buy a bunch of extracts.

00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:53.312
Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and&nbsp;match add-ins

00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:57.364
to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.

00:05:57.364 --> 00:06:03.195
So I'm going&nbsp;to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip 
with a little bit of orange zest.

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:06.983
This is the master&nbsp;recipe with no alterations to it.

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:14.443
I'm going to add in 1/2 cup of dried cranberries because, 
like I said before, we're going to use 1 cup of add-ins total.

00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:20.150
That means that the white chocolate&nbsp;chips 
will also come in at 1/2 cup for 1 cup total.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.143
I didn't have any orange extract today but&nbsp;that's okay because, 
a little bit of orange zest,

00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:30.000
1-2 tablespoons total, 
will add just a&nbsp;hint of orange flavor.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.343
Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in 
until the ingredients&nbsp;are evenly distributed.

00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:42.193
You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, 
really the possibilities are endless.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:47.635
Last I want to show you how to add in spices which is super easy, 
and I really don't have to show you,

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:53.177
but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin 
with cinnamon chips folded in,

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:58.336
topped with&nbsp;a brown sugar streusel, 
and that's just delicious.

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:03.733
I've already creamed together the butter and&nbsp;sugar, 
added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract,

00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:07.686
and now I'm going to add in 1&nbsp;teaspoon of ground cinnamon.

00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:10.981
You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon,

00:07:10.981 --> 00:07:16.438
it really&nbsp;just depends on how pronounced you want 
that cinnamon flavor to be.

00:07:16.438 --> 00:07:21.490
Finish with the rest of&nbsp;the master muffin recipe 
by adding in the flour and buttermilk.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.150
I'm going to fold in 1 cup of&nbsp;cinnamon chips,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.106
which are delicious but they can be a little harder to find 
when it's not the holidays.

00:07:29.106 --> 00:07:35.530
Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups 
before making your streusel topping.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:42.191
A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition 
to lots of different flavors of&nbsp;muffins.

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:46.389
It starts with 1/4 cup of cold, cubed butter,

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:51.493
then you'll add in 1/2 cup of&nbsp;brown sugar 
and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour,

00:07:51.493 --> 00:07:54.384
adding in 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.

00:07:54.384 --> 00:08:00.000
Then use a pastry cutter or you can use 2 knives 
cutting across each other like this.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.637
Then you&nbsp;want to cut this all together 
until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.

00:08:05.637 --> 00:08:10.212
Then you want to sprinkle&nbsp;this generously on top of your muffin batter.

00:08:10.212 --> 00:08:18.447
It's almost like having little&nbsp;piles of sand on top of each muffin, 
and of course the baking time&nbsp;on all of these are the same.

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:25.709
Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor&nbsp;of muffin 
that you want using one master recipe.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.723
