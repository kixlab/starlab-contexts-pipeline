Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.080
They are loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.199
So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.959
So in a large bowl combine two cups of all-purpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.369
half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.678
Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.579
Now mix that reserve tablespoon of the flour mixture with one-and-a-half cups of fresh blueberries

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.980
The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.639
During baking the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.499
Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.270
You want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.249
Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.949
You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.729
So the key to really fluffy muffins is well beaten eggs

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.830
Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.009
Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add 3/4 cups of heavy cream

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.399
Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.129
So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.080
Once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.890
Continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.459
All right

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.679
Now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries and at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.130
Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop. I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.170
Like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.179
And before the muffins go into the oven you want to make that simple streusel. In a small bowl combine a 1 tablespoon of unsalted

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.230
cold cubed butter,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.420
2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.410
Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.010
Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170
 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.669
