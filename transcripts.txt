do you love moist fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that sky-high bakery top and a nice crisp edge well today's your lucky day because i'm going to show you how to make them hey you're watching preppy kitchen where i john canel teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends these chocolate chip muffins are going to whip up in a snap so let's get started first off set that oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit we want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakery style dome on top if you did 350 they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin okay now for the dry ingredients i'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results but if you're using cups click up here for my how to measure flower video it shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly it's a thing that goes wrong the most often in baking and it sucks when you add too much flour okay into my bowl and i'm using a sifter here i'm adding in two and three quarter cups that is 330 grams of all-purpose flour one teaspoon of salt and that might seem like a lot but do you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin for leavening i'm using one tablespoon of baking powder and again it's kind of a lot of leavening agent but this is how you get that bakery style top sift it out we're done with that scale and get set aside as well give it a quick whisk now we can set it aside this was melted a minute ago it already cooled down i'm going to put it into the microwave for the wet ingredients it's important that you're dealing with room temperature things and if it gets cold we're going to warm it up in the microwave and ps it's going to get cold this counter is freezing all right 300 ml or 1 4 cups of whole milk in yoga half a cup or 113 grams of unsalted butter that's been melted and get it all out there so by the by today is the first time ever in the history of preppy kitchen that brian is filming you wanna say hi no he's eating cookies that i made one cup or 200 grams of sugar right in that bowl let's give it a whisk to bring it together if you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds and it should be totally fine i used warm milk so it's not happening to me so right now we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream two large eggs one two as well as one quarter cup of sour cream and if you don't have that you can go ahead and use full fat plain yogurt it'll be completely delicious still this is optional but i am adding one tablespoon of vanilla that's 15 ml wow delicious i'm gonna mix this up right now but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this what's going on here look it's turned into like a like a butter mush that's not what i want so i will be popping this into the microwave after i whisk the eggs in you don't want to do that before the eggs get whisked in because they could be overcooked a little heat's going to fix all of our problems okay a little bit of heat later let's give this a whisk that's nice nice homogeneous fluid mixture is what we want now it's time to pour the wet into the dry give it a whisk and take it to almost combined you could have a couple clumps of like flour hanging out here and there because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in so you can see we have a couple clumps here and there but it's no big deal it's time for some chocolate the best part all right in my recipe i specify one and a half cups of semi-sweet chocolate but i'm living large and using one cup of semi-sweet and half a cup of bittersweet you could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer here we go that's the bittersweet chocolate and i'm taking a handful of the semi-sweet chips and reserving them because i'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes rest of the chocolate chips go in and you should fold them in with a spatula not use a whisk after those chocolate chips are folded in it's time to pop this into the muffin tins i'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper it's gonna be different i've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice cut of butter good dash of flour move all that flour around and then dump out the excess all right and for the rest i'm going to use muffin papers which go a bit higher so you won't have that like mushroom shaped muffin top but they should still rise up with a nice dome in you go unlike with cakes some people really prefer that nice crispy muffin edge so if that's your jam then you're going to want to do it without the papers just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily i'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin and i want to fill it up all the way normally it's two-thirds of the way high for cupcakes but this time it's full to the brim okay fill those papers up and when you're doing that try to be careful about getting like batter on the edges it'll burn it's just a matter of how it looks it'll still bake fine when you're scooping the batter it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount you want to have an equal distribution so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips scoop up some chips after the batter goes in you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips this is not super necessary but it'll give you nice glossy melty chocolate tops and it makes a big difference the chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top okay this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins and now it's time to go into the oven you need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set and then the top can burst through to create that big bakery style dome this is gonna go into the oven at 425 fahrenheit for five minutes then we'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes depending you want to have a nice golden top that's set in the middle so you can insert a skewer through the center and it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate right into the oven you go out of the oven and cooled just enough touch i want to show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper out of paper so nice crisp edge muffin over a little bit and golden brown in the paper the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge it's really like soft all over and just delicious you've got to take a look at the inside of this take a look if you like this video check out my chocolate playlist someone's making crazy faces behind the camera if you like this video check out my chocolate playlist it has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious you've got to check it

Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my&nbsp;master muffin recipe. Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my master muffin recipe,  which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Then line&nbsp;a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick&nbsp;cooking spray,  right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking. Now&nbsp;it's time to put together our batter. First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter,&nbsp; and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different&nbsp;way  that you can build upon the base recipe. The batter starts with 1/2 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar. We're going&nbsp;to use a hand mixer to cream this together. At first this mixture will be lumpy,  but keep on&nbsp;mixing for about 2 minutes. After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined,  and&nbsp;it'll be a smooth, paste-like, creamy consistency. Then you'll add in 2 large eggs,  and mix this&nbsp;briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds. Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla&nbsp;extract,  or you can use other flavors of extract, like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract. Those are all super popular options. For the lemon and citrus extracts  I recommend only using 1/2 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. You'll also need 2&nbsp;teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. This is also the point where you'd add in any&nbsp;spices  like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice. We're gonna give this a quick mix just to combine,  about&nbsp;10 seconds. Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer  and grab a rubber spatula. Add in&nbsp;half of your all-purpose flour. You're going to use 2 cups total,  so you're going to add in&nbsp;1 cup right now. Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in. Once all those white specks of&nbsp;flour start to disappear,  you'll pour in 1/2 cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is&nbsp;going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin. And you'll stir this in as well until it's well&nbsp;combined. Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of all-purpose flour. Stir this together scraping&nbsp;the sides and bottom of the bowl  to ensure that everything gets mixed in. Now if you're gonna&nbsp;add anything into your muffins,  like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time&nbsp;to do so. but I'll show you that in just a minute. Your batter should be thick but also spreadable. We're gonna divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups,  and you should fill each one about&nbsp;2/3 of the way full. It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2/3 or what's 3/4,  so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12&nbsp;muffins. You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes  before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch it's totally okay to let it  rest in between cooking different&nbsp;batches. Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the&nbsp;temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door. Continue baking for 12-15 minutes,  and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your&nbsp;oven. Now let's start going over some variations,  starting with a lemon blueberry muffin. This is&nbsp;great because it demonstrates both using  another flavor of extract as well as adding in fresh fruit. I've already creamed together the sugar and butter  and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add&nbsp;in 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract  before adding in my&nbsp;baking powder and salt. Continue on with the rest of the recipe  adding in the flour and buttermilk. Once you have your batter finished  you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even,  you&nbsp;can use those too. Then this is optional but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon,  so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. Then simply fold this in. Then it's just a matter of once again dividing&nbsp;the batter evenly  amongst the 12 muffin cups. One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling&nbsp;on about  1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy&nbsp;sweet top,  and then of course bake these just as we did before. Next up i'm going to show you how to&nbsp;make a chocolate version. For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again  just like&nbsp;before, but this time you'll add in 1/2 cup of cocoa powder,  unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream&nbsp;that in with it. From here you'll proceed with the rest of the  master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour,  and milk or buttermilk. The addition of the&nbsp;cocoa powder really doesn't do much  to change the texture of the final batter. Then just for&nbsp;fun i'm going to add in  1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and fold those in. Even though&nbsp;you can mix and match add-ins,  you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips,&nbsp;or nuts, or dried fruit,  to 1 cup total. Next i'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin&nbsp;hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors  by using instant pudding. This&nbsp;time you're only going to add in 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going&nbsp;to replace that additional 1/4 cup  with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this&nbsp;time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors. Cream this together and then&nbsp;proceed with  the master muffin recipe as directed. You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if&nbsp;you wanted. This variation is fun because there's just  so many different flavors of instant&nbsp;pudding out there. It makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly&nbsp; without having to buy a bunch of extracts. Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and&nbsp;match add-ins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle. So I'm going&nbsp;to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip  with a little bit of orange zest. This is the master&nbsp;recipe with no alterations to it. I'm going to add in 1/2 cup of dried cranberries because,  like I said before, we're going to use 1 cup of add-ins total. That means that the white chocolate&nbsp;chips  will also come in at 1/2 cup for 1 cup total. I didn't have any orange extract today but&nbsp;that's okay because,  a little bit of orange zest, 1-2 tablespoons total,  will add just a&nbsp;hint of orange flavor. Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in  until the ingredients&nbsp;are evenly distributed. You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts,  really the possibilities are endless. Last I want to show you how to add in spices which is super easy,  and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin  with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with&nbsp;a brown sugar streusel,  and that's just delicious. I've already creamed together the butter and&nbsp;sugar,  added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1&nbsp;teaspoon of ground cinnamon. You can use between 1/2 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon, it really&nbsp;just depends on how pronounced you want  that cinnamon flavor to be. Finish with the rest of&nbsp;the master muffin recipe  by adding in the flour and buttermilk. I'm going to fold in 1 cup of&nbsp;cinnamon chips, which are delicious but they can be a little harder to find  when it's not the holidays. Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups  before making your streusel topping. A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition  to lots of different flavors of&nbsp;muffins. It starts with 1/4 cup of cold, cubed butter, then you'll add in 1/2 cup of&nbsp;brown sugar  and 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, adding in 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Then use a pastry cutter or you can use 2 knives  cutting across each other like this. Then you&nbsp;want to cut this all together  until it resembles a coarse meal or sand. Then you want to sprinkle&nbsp;this generously on top of your muffin batter. It's almost like having little&nbsp;piles of sand on top of each muffin,  and of course the baking time&nbsp;on all of these are the same. Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor&nbsp;of muffin  that you want using one master recipe. Thanks for watching.

Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins They are loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with a simple and delicious brown sugar streusel So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients So in a large bowl combine two cups of all-purpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture Now mix that reserve tablespoon of the flour mixture with one-and-a-half cups of fresh blueberries The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter During baking the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer You want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes So the key to really fluffy muffins is well beaten eggs Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add 3/4 cups of heavy cream Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between Once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter Continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter All right Now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries and at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop. I Like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional And before the muffins go into the oven you want to make that simple streusel. In a small bowl combine a 1 tablespoon of unsalted cold cubed butter, 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 3 tablespoons of brown sugar Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share it, like and subscribe to our channel So you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
