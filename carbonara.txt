There are 3 types of segments:\n    a) A segment that directly or roughly corresponds to one of the provided `subgoals`.\n    b) A segment that contains procedural information, but does not correspond to any of the provided `subgoals`.\n    c) A segment that does not contain procedural information. Usually, at the beginning or end of the video.\n\nStep 2-a: If a segment is of type (a), assign the corresponding `subgoal` to it and, if necessary, update the description of the `subgoal` so that it also covers the content of the segment.\nStep 2-b: If a segment is of type (b), define a new `subgoal` that follows these requirements:\n    a) Goal-Oriented: Represents an overarching objective or subtask that structures the process into meaningful phases.\n    b) Procedural: Describes a procedural objective that is essential for progressing in the task.\n    c) Generalizable: Accommodates variations in materials, tools, methods, and outcomes.\nStep 2-c: If a segment is of type (c), ignore it.\n\nOutput the segmented narration based on the `subgoals`.\n"
