WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-49: The sauce uses only egg yolks instead of whole eggs. Then the sauce can go in, and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water, making this nice and creamy.

WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-86: The sauce includes Parmigiano Reggiano cheese in addition to Pecorino Romano. Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-93: The sauce uses bacon fat as part of the ingredients. And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-90: Tongs are used for handling the pasta. And gentle with the pasta.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-95: Recommends using a thick pan like La Crusade for better heat retention. I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-97: Suggests placing the pan over simmering pasta water to gently heat the sauce if needed. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-102: Suggests using simmering pasta water to gently heat the sauce if it doesn't thicken. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.

WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-13: The video suggests using the 'hold the yolk with your thumb' trick to separate the yolks easily. We'll just do the classic hold the yolk with your thumb trick.

WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-63: The video mentions using a grater for finely grating cheese. I've added peas to a dish that is otherwise vegetablefree.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-53: The video suggests optionally placing the pan on low heat to thicken the sauce further. If you want to really see not carbonara, here's an earlier attempt where I used whole egg, too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-53: The video explains that adding pasta water helps melt the cheese and achieve a creamy sauce consistency. If you want to really see not carbonara, here's an earlier attempt where I used whole egg, too much heat, and for some reason this came out way worse than my first attempt with whole egg, which came out great.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-52: The video suggests using freshly cracked black pepper for better flavor. We'll finish with some pepper pepper pepper, and some more pecorino or parmesan, and here we don't have carbonara.
WARNING: Low alignment score D_2DBLAt57c-75: The video mentions using bacon or guanciale. It's about quality ingredients, the guanciale, the pecorino romana, quality eggs, the pepper, the technique of the pepper, good pasta and then the sensitivity of cooking it right.

WARNING: Low alignment score D_2DBLAt57c-70: The video uses a sieve to separate peppercorn skins after cracking them. Carbonara and you finish with more pepper.
WARNING: Low alignment score D_2DBLAt57c-75: The video explains that the creaminess of the sauce is achieved through the emulsification of the cooking water and the fat from the bacon. It's about quality ingredients, the guanciale, the pecorino romana, quality eggs, the pepper, the technique of the pepper, good pasta and then the sensitivity of cooking it right.
WARNING: Low alignment score D_2DBLAt57c-75: The video emphasizes that timing is crucial to achieve the right consistency without frying the eggs.

WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-49: The video uses Pecorino Romano cheese as the primary cheese for the sauce. Then the sauce can go in, and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water, making this nice and creamy.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-49: The video uses coarse ground black pepper as a seasoning for the sauce. Then the sauce can go in, and the egg will cook just enough from the noodle heat, although you can put your pan on low to thicken it as well, because here comes more pasta water, making this nice and creamy.
WARNING: Low alignment score 75p4UHRIMcU-50: The video instructs to add pasta water to the sauce ingredients to help melt the cheese and achieve a creamy consistency. The reason we add pasta water is so that if you get thirsty while you eat it, you don't have to stop and have a drink.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-54: The video uses guanciale (pork cheek) or pancetta as the meat component for the sauce. And now it comes, yes, the resistance, the actual sauce.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-54: The video includes Parmesan cheese as part of the cheese mixture for the sauce. And now it comes, yes, the resistance, the actual sauce.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-57: The video uses a bowl for mixing egg yolks and cheese before adding to the pasta. You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-57: The video instructs to let the pasta cool slightly before adding the egg mixture. You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.

WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-18: Includes Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as an ingredient in addition to Pecorino Romano. Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-37: Uses freshly ground black pepper as an ingredient. If you didn't know already, Gilbert is just fresh ground black pepper.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-21: Uses a cheese grater or box grater to finely grate the cheeses. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-30: The egg and cheese mixture should have a creamy consistency. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-28: Instructs to separate two egg yolks and combine them with three whole eggs. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.

WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-86: The egg and cheese mixture includes Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano. Once you have all the pasta out, now we're going to add in that beautiful egg and cheese mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-93: The sauce uses bacon fat. And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-90: Tongs are used to handle the pasta. And gentle with the pasta.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-102: Add a little pasta water if the sauce is too thick. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-97: Place the pan over simmering pasta water to gently heat the sauce if it doesn't thicken. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score D_2DBLAt57c-57: The sauce uses guanciale fat instead of bacon fat. That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.
WARNING: Low alignment score D_2DBLAt57c-62: A bowl and whisk are used to prepare the egg mixture. Only then can we think about adding our egg.
WARNING: Low alignment score D_2DBLAt57c-57: Use cooking water to emulsify with the guanciale fat to create a creamy sauce. That water and the fat, that is what's going to emulsify to become a creamy sauce.

WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-28: The video uses 3 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks for the egg mixture. So I'm doing three whole eggs, as well as two egg yolks.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-18: The video uses both Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses. Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-21: The video mentions using a cheese grater or box grater for grating cheese. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-30: The video instructs to gradually whisk in the cheeses until the mixture is smooth. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-26: The video explains that the mixture of whole eggs and yolks provides richness without being overly heavy. A lot of recipes call for all whole, all yolks.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-18: The video explains that the combination of Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses adds depth of flavor. Here we have Pecorino Romano, it's a sheep's milk cheese, this one is aged.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-40: The video suggests adjusting the amount of black pepper according to preference. Put as much pepper or as little pepper as you like, and whisk it in.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-19: The video suggests adding a little pasta water if the mixture seems too thick. I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-30: The video warns to be careful not to scramble the eggs when mixing them with the pasta. Go ahead and whisk that all up, and then we'll start whisking our cheese into our egg mixture.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-25: The video uses two eggs with a lovely color for the sauce. And now you take some good eggs, and for two people you take two eggs.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-32: The video specifies using a bowl to mix the ingredients. In Roma, they use also pecorino cheese, which is a cheese to be grated.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-28: The video explains that no cream is added because it is forbidden in the traditional recipe. To this, you don't add any, any, any cream.

WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-39: The video warns against adding oil to the pasta water. We reduce it a little bit because I'm going to see what the pasta does.

WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-93: The video uses bacon fat as part of the sauce ingredients. And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-104: The video uses tongs to handle the pasta and mix the sauce. And help establish that creamy sauce that has no cream.
WARNING: Low alignment score dzyXBU3dIys-102: The video suggests adding pasta water if the sauce is too thick. And if it looks too thick to you, also what you can do is just add a little bit of that pasta water.

WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-54: The video uses guanciale (pork cheek) or pancetta as part of the sauce ingredients. And now it comes, yes, the resistance, the actual sauce.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-57: The video uses a bowl for mixing egg yolks and cheese. You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.
WARNING: Low alignment score 3AAdKl1UYZs-57: The video instructs to let the pasta cool slightly before adding the egg mixture. You see usually by this stage the heat is so much in the wrong cooking that the eggs become scrambled eggs.
