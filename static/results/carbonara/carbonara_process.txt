    "text": "You need to understand, carbonara does not need cream, or peas, or ham, or whatever else people are putting in it. It's so simple! Today, hang out for a second, and you're gonna learn how to do it right. Let's not waste any time, now let's go! Traditionally, you're gonna see spaghetti carbonara made with guanciale, which is the jowl, meaning the cheek of a pig that's been cured. So for this video, of course, I could have ordered guanciale, but I know most of my audience is American, so I want the most people possible to actually make this, so we're gonna use bacon. And thick cut bacon would be best. You could also use pancetta.",

That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description.",

Let that roll. Check it on the bacon. I turned the heat down in the end. Be careful not to overcook this. Looks pretty much perfect. First, I'm going to take some out for garnish.

And the pasta water, the bacon fat, the cheese and egg mixture is now emulsifying all over this pasta. You see how creamy this is? I'm also using these La Crusade pans, which I'll link in the description, and they hold a lot of heat. So I don't think I even need to do my plan, but I can show you why I left that pasta water on. Because if it doesn't thicken up like you like, literally what you can do is set that pan back on top of that pasta water and like a double boil or bainmarie, it will keep cooking the egg mixture. But I don't think I even really need to do this. But that's a good option, especially if you're using a pan that's not as thick as this. Oh, my God. Looks so good.",

Cook for 8 minutes.\nPrepare the guanciale by removing the skin and slicing it into 1 cm thick pieces, then chop into 0.5 cm chunks.\nPlace the guanciale in a cold pan and turn the heat to medium-high to render the fat.\nCrack a garlic clove and add it to the pan with the guanciale to infuse flavor.\nCrack black peppercorns using a pestle and mortar, then sift to use the hotter inner part of the peppercorns.\nOnce the guanciale is golden, remove the garlic from the pan.\nCrack eggs into a bowl and add 20 grams of pecorino romano cheese. Whisk together.\nTurn off the heat under the guanciale pan and add the cooked pasta directly from the pot, along with some pasta water, to the pan.\nStir the pasta with the guanciale and fat, allowing the water and fat to emulsify into a creamy sauce.\nAdd the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, stirring quickly to avoid scrambling the eggs.\nAdjust the sauce consistency by adding more pasta water if needed, ensuring a creamy texture.\nFinish with additional cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of pecorino romano cheese before serving."

    "text": "Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish. Pasta, cheese, bacon. What's not to love, right? But it's really controversial. I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe. So first up guys, you only need five ingredients. Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork. And as you can see, it's all about the fat. It's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried and it's aged. Of course, it's similar to smoked bacon and you can get some pretty good results actually. But you can see this is quite lean. So try and get them to not cut off the fat because you need it. Or there's pancetta. Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano. Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg. Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.",
