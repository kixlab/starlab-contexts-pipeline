I think this is what is traditionally used when you're making spaghetti carbonara, but as always, if you watch this channel, you know I love ParmigianoReggiano. That's not to be confused with Parmesan, make sure it says ParmigianoReggiano, and it's from Italy, and you'll know you have the good stuff. So what I'm gonna do is a mixture of both these cheeses, and you want them to be pretty fine, so I'm gonna be using this cheese grater, and if you don't have one of those, just use this setting on a box grater, and just get to shredding. I'm gonna do about three ounces of each of these cheeses, so half and half, but as always, with my videos, the full recipe is gonna be down in the description. Underneath this video, you just gotta click that little arrow, and it'll open up. So here's all our beautiful cheese.",

Let that roll. Check it on the bacon. I turned the heat down in the end. Be careful not to overcook this. Looks pretty much perfect. First, I'm going to take some out for garnish.

Cook for 8 minutes.\nPrepare the guanciale by removing the skin and slicing it into 1 cm thick pieces, then chop into 0.5 cm chunks.\nPlace the guanciale in a cold pan and turn the heat to medium-high to render the fat.\nCrack a garlic clove and add it to the pan with the guanciale to infuse flavor.\nCrack black peppercorns using a pestle and mortar, then sift to use the hotter inner part of the peppercorns.\nOnce the guanciale is golden, remove the garlic from the pan.\nCrack eggs into a bowl and add 20 grams of pecorino romano cheese. Whisk together.\nTurn off the heat under the guanciale pan and add the cooked pasta directly from the pot, including some pasta water, to stop frying and start emulsifying.\nToss the pasta in the pan with the guanciale and fat, adding more pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.\nAdd the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, tossing quickly to avoid scrambling the eggs.\nFinish with additional cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of pecorino romano cheese before serving."

    "text": "Hi guys, we're gonna make spaghetti carbonara, a classic Italian dish. Pasta, cheese, bacon. What's not to love, right? But it's really controversial. I want to give you what I think is the most authentic recipe. So first up guys, you only need five ingredients. Guanciale. This is the cured cheek of pork. And as you can see, it's all about the fat. It's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried and it's aged. Of course, it's similar to smoked bacon and you can get some pretty good results actually. But you can see this is quite lean. So try and get them to not cut off the fat because you need it. Or there's pancetta. Then, most people use parmesan. But actually, the more classic is pecorino romano. Sheep's cheese. It's crumbly, it's salty, freerange organic egg. Pasta, black pepper and then optional, garlic.",
