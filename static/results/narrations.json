    "text": "need to understand carbonara does not\nneed cream or peas or\nham or whatever else people are putting\nin it it's so simple\ntoday hang out for a second and you're\ngoing to learn how to do it right\nlet's not waste any time now let's go\ntraditionally you're going to see\nspaghetti carbonara made with guanchali\nwhich is the jowl meaning the cheek of a\npig that's been cured\nso for this video of course i could have\nordered guanciale\nbut i know most of my audience is\namerican so i want the most people\npossible to actually make this so we're\ngoing to use\nbacon and thick cut bacon would be best\nyou could also use pancetta so i'll take\nabout a half pound of bacon\nand we're going to slice this just\npretty thick this way\nthat's about three quarters of an inch\nturn this pan on to medium heat\ni'm doing a tiny bit of olive oil i\ndon't think it's traditional but when\ni'm cooking italian food it just feels\nright\nthen go ahead and break your bacon into\nthat pan\nand what we're going to do here is\nslowly render out the fat\nfrom this bacon get it nice and crispy\nwe'll use most of it in the pasta and\nthen we'll actually use some for garnish\nbecause who doesn't like crispy bacon on\ntop now\nbacon is rendering pasta water is coming\nup to a boil\nand we're gonna season our pasta water\njust a little bit about a tablespoon\nof salt kosher salt into about four\nquarts of water\nusually i'm going to put more salt in\nbecause there's so many salty elements\nin carbonara i want to put less salt in\nthe pasta water so\nfirst is very important we need to talk\nabout the cheese\nhere we have pecorino romano it's a\nsheep's milk cheese this one is aged\ni think this is what is traditionally\nused when you're making spaghetti\ncarbonara\nbut as always if you watch this channel\nyou know i love parmigiano leggiano\nthat's not to be confused with parmesan\nmake sure it says parmigiano reggiano\nand it's from italy\nand you'll know you have the good stuff\nso what i'm going to do is a mixture of\nboth these cheeses\nand you want them to be pretty fine so\ni'm going to be using this cheese grater\nand if you don't have one of those just\nuse this setting on a box grater\nand just get to shredding i'm going to\ndo about three ounces of each of these\ncheeses so half and half\nbut as always with my videos the full\nrecipe is going to be down in the\ndescription underneath this video you\njust gotta click that little arrow\nand it'll open up so here's all our\nbeautiful cheese\nokay now time for the eggs a lot of\nrecipes call for all whole\nall yolks i like to do a mixture of both\nso i'm doing three whole eggs as well as\ntwo egg yolks\nthe way i see it carbonar is already so\nrich it doesn't need\nall egg yolks go ahead and whisk that\nall up\nand then we'll start whisking our cheese\ninto our egg mixture\nand you'll see all that and it looked\nlike so much cheese right but as this\nbreaks down\nit won't look like that anymore add that\nall in and so now we have a consistency\nlike this\nnow this is a very important time for\nour good friend\nsergeant gilbert i'm gonna put quite a\nbit of gilbert's insides\ninto this egg mixture if you didn't know\nalready gilbert is just fresh ground\nblack pepper\nhe's a sentient being a pepper grinder\nwho became self-aware in 2020. you know\nand this is preference put as much\npepper or as little pepper as\nyou like and whisk it in as you can see\nthere's a lot of fat coming out of this\nbacon\njust want to turn this occasionally and\nwe are going to be using some but not\nall of this fat\nin the actual spaghetti carbonara\nanother thing you can do is just take a\nlittle bit of that boiling water\nand add it to the eggs quickly whisk\nthat in\nwe're kind of equalizing the\ntemperatures here and loosening up this\negg mixture a little bit\nand it's going to make the whole pasta\ncome together a lot easier in the end\ni put just about a quarter cup in here\nour bacon is almost rendered\nso now we'll drop our spaghetti we'll\ntry to do that twisty thing\nkind of worked just get a little bit of\nwater up on it\nlet that roll check it on the bacon i\nturned the heat down in the end be\ncareful not to overcook this\nlooks pretty much perfect first i'm\ngonna take some out for garnish drain it\non a paper towel\nnow i'm turning off the heat of this pan\nand i'm gonna drain off\nmost of the fat all except for about two\ntablespoons or so\nand then just set that back over there\nremember now heat is off this is so\nimportant\nokay and of course we're going to put\nsome olive oil in this pasta no we're\nnot going to do that\nwhy do people do that it's a myth it's a\nmyth just like msg is\ngoing to give you cancer or whatever\nit's just not true and it serves no\npurpose so don't do it\ndon't do it okay another thing i want to\nshare with you there are tons of\nexpensive pasta brands out in the world\nbut honestly like i like these cheap\nitalian brands like this one\ndeco i don't know how to say it but like\ni don't know why i just prefer the cheap\none so\nif anyone's wondering this is what i use\nso we'll cook this spaghetti about 10\nminutes in this pot\njust slightly al dente and then we'll\nfinish it over in this baking pan\nremember still no heat on this pan i'm\ngoing to explain all this soon but you\nwant to leave this water\nin this pot this will make sense in a\nminute so here we go it's been 10\nminutes\nwe're just going to use our tongs here\ndrop that in there\ntrust me this spaghetti is generating a\nridiculous amount of heat\nturn that pasta water down to a simmer\nonce you have all the pasta out now\nwe're going to add in that beautiful egg\nand cheese mixture\nthe whole trick here and what you really\nneed to keep in mind is that we do not\nwant to scramble these eggs\nthe eggs are going to cook from the heat\nof this pasta\n[Music]\nand very gently and beautifully in a\nvelvety fluffy\ncreamy way coat it all up right\ndon't worry you're not eating raw eggs\nand gentle with the pasta you don't want\nto break it\noh man\nand the pasta water the bacon fat the\ncheese and egg mixture is now\nemulsifying all over this pasta\nyou see how creamy this is i'm also\nusing these la crusade pans which i'll\nlink in the description\nand they hold a lot of heat so i don't\nthink i even need\nto do my plan but i can show you why i\nleft that pasta water on\nbecause if it doesn't thicken up like\nyou like literally what you can do is\nset that pan back on top of that pasta\nwater\nand like a double boil or ban marie\n[Music]\nit will keep cooking the egg mixture but\ni don't think i even really need to do\nthis\nbut that's a good option especially if\nyou're using a pan that's not as thick\nas this\noh my god looks so good\nand if it looks too thick to you also\nwhat you can do is just add a little bit\nof that pasta water that's going to\nloosen it up\nand help establish that creamy sauce\nthat has no cream\ndone no scramble nothing go ahead and\nplate this up\njust get it off the tongs like so oh\nman now to finish a little more\nparmigiano-reggiano\nall over nothing wrong with that\nand of course some of your crispy bacon\njust for an added crunch\nthat is a bonus no one is going to\ncomplain about trust me\ni mean how bad do you want to tuck into\nthis treat\nallow me to try oh allow me to try it\nfor you\nhere we go a little bacon\noh my gosh i see a lot of people who\nleave my youtube videos right now it's\nsuch a big mistake\nthey obviously don't know about the\nfridge\ngod that's good you gotta make this\nhere's my rolling pin i just feel like\nthis is what an italian grandmother\nwould do\n[Music]\nwhat well i hope that helped until next\ntime my friends\nyou know i love you when i'm out"

    "text": "Pasta. Cream. Bacon.\nCream?\nHi, guys! We're gonna make spaghetti carbonara,\na classic Italian dish pasta.\nCheese, bacon. What's not to love, right?\nBut it's really controversial.\nI want to give you what I\nthink is the most authentic recipe.\nSo first up guys, you only need five ingredients.\nGuanciale.\nThis is the cured cheek of pork,\nand as you can see, it's all about the fat.\nIt's salted, it's got pepper, it's dried, and it's aged.\nOf course, it's similar to smoked bacon,\nand you can get some pretty good results, actually,\nbut you can see this is quite lean,\nso try and get them to not cut off the fat\nbecause you need it.\nOr, there's pancetta.\nThen most people use parmesan,\nbut actually, the more classic is pecorino romano.\nSheep's cheese, it's crumbly, it's salty.\nFree-range, organic egg,\npasta,\nblack pepper,\nand then, optional, garlic.\nSo first up guys, grab the pasta by two hands,\ntwist it, into the water.\nBy twisting it, it won't stick together.\nPut a tiny amount of salt in this water\nbecause the cheese and the guanciale is salty.\nThis beautiful pasta takes eight\nminutes to cook.\nSo I've got my guanciale.\nI'm gonna remove the skin and I'm\ngonna take a nice centimeter slice\nof the guanciale, roughly chop this\nto about half centimeter chunks.\nNow, the pan is cold.\nTurn it on to a medium high heat.\nThe reason I want it cold is because\nI want to render the fat out.\nThe guanciale goes in to the pan,\nand this pan is getting hot.\nGive the garlic a crack, and then put it in the pan.\nAs this starts to sizzle, the fat will just pull out some\nof that perfume from the garlic.\nThen there's the\nblack pepper.\nGet your peppercorns in a pestle and\nmortar.\nCrack it.\nGet a little sieve.\nThis is one of the most important little bits\nand no one really does it, okay? Honestly.\nThis is the outer skin. This is much\nmilder.\nWhat we have here is the inside part\nof the peppercorn, which is hotter,\nperfect for a good, hot carbonara.\nThe guanciale is getting golden.\nNow, let's get on to the eggs.\nEggs are really, really delicate,\nand if you don't treat these right,\nyou end up with stir-fried noodles,\nand we don't want that.\nI'm going to take a bowl,\nand I'm going to crack the egg straight into there,\nand I'm just going to add a little pecorino to that,\nto like 20 grams.\nNow, we're time-sensitive, so we're\ngoing to have a little whisk up.\nWe've got dark guanciale.\nYou've got the fat that's come out of it,\nand that's what you want.\nYou want attitude and colors.\nNow, I'm going to remove that garlic,\nturn the heat off,\nand you're going to drag the pasta\nand the water into the pan.\nUse the water to stop the frying.\nA bit fo water! A bit of water!\nThat water and the fat, that's what's\ngonna emulsify to become a creamy sauce.\nWe're not frying anymore, can you\nhear that?\nQuiet; no frying at all.\nOnly then, can we think about adding our egg.\nAs we toss, we add some more liquid.\nHa-ha!\nThat's the cream.\nYou get the cream through the emulsification of\nthe cooking water, and the fat,\nand technique,\nand timing.\nSo as simple as this is, it's technical.\nGet your friends, your family,\nget them around the table, glass of wine,\nLook at that, guys, look at that!\nCarbonara!\nAnd you finish with more pepper.\nWow!\nI'm so excited.\nSpaghetti carbonara with a beautiful,\nlittle finishing of pecorino.\nThat is as classic as I can give you guys.\nFrom chefs, from nonnas, it's about quality ingredients,\nthe guanciale, the pecorino romano,\nquality eggs,\nthe pepper \u2014 the technique of the pepper,\na good pasta,\nand then the sensitivity of cooking it right.\nCome on.\nThere's a little platter for two people,\nand of course, the most important thing,\nwhen you eat pasta is don't watch it, eat it!\nMmmm.\nThat, my friends, is a thing of joy."

    "text": "Hey folks,\nAbout a year ago,\na group of real-deal Italian chefs\nsavagely critiqued some of the biggest\nCarbonara videos on the Internet.\nAnd as you may remember,\nmy entry was not very well received.\nSince then I've dreamt of\nnothing but Redemption.\nSo today we're gonna take a crack at\ntwo different versions of Carbonara,\na real-deal old-school Italian version,\nand a more modern less traditional\nversion that's sure to piss em' off!\nLet's get down to basics.\n[Intro Music]\nAll right. So before we can make Carbonara, we've got to make \"Carbonara\"\nwhich by definition, is made with\n\"Guanciale\", a type of cured pork jowl.\nIt is very delicious but a little hard to find.\nSo if you can't find it, you can sub\nwith Pancetta if you're in a pinch.\nI've got maybe a half-pound here that\nI'm gonna cut into relatively sizable chunks\nand then set aside to make one of the essential\nelements of any Carbonara dish: The Egg Slurry.\nInto a medium bowl or measuring cup goes 3 large eggs,\nand 1 egg yolk for a little added richness.\nAnd then it's time to finely grate and\nmeasure out 4 ounces of cheese.\nTruly traditional \"Carbonara\" uses\n100% Pecorino Romano Cheese,\nbut is commonly balanced out\nwith Parmigiano-Reggiano.\nIf you want it a little less sharp and\na little more nutty, I'm going for a 50/50 ratio.\nInto which I'm going to dump our beaten eggs.\nWe're then going to beat this whole affair\ntogether with a fork until homogenous.\nThe only other thing you're gonna want to add is\na whole lot of freshly ground black pepper.\nWe're not adding any salt yet\nbecause \"Guanciale\" can vary in saltiness,\nand we don't want to oversalt our dish.\nBeat that together until well incorporated and\nthen it's time to head over to the Stovetop,\nwhere we are introducing the \"Guanciale\" to a cold pan.\nWe're then gonna turn the heat to medium.\nThis is gonna cook the \"Guanciale\" more slowly\nand allow more of its fat to render out\nwhich in traditional \"Carbonara\" is a good thing.\nOnce it is fully cooked but not too crispy,\nwe're gonna kill the heat\nand put our pasta in the hot tub.\nThe water is \"Salato come il mare\",\nor as salty as the sea.\nAnd we gotta keep it moving to\nprevent it from sticking together.\nAnd then a cool trick to determine pasta's doneness\nis to take out a strand and eat it to see if it's done.\nDon't throw it against the wall, you friggin' weirdo.\nAs you can see, our pork jowl has\nalmost entirely stopped bubbling.\nThat's exactly where we want it to be.\nAnd as soon as the pasta is done,\nwe're dumping it directly into\nthe saute pan with the \"Guanciale\".\nOnce all the pasta is being added\nwe're gonna toss it around in the pan,\nensuring that it is evenly\ncovered in all that \"Guanciale\" fat.\nAnd you wanna work quickly here.\nBecause the only thing that's going to\ncook our egg slurry and make it smooth and creamy\nis the residual heat from the Pasta.\nSo waste no time getting the egg and cheese\nmixture in there and then agitate rigorously!\nThis is going to help emulsify the sauce\nand keep it creamy and prevent it from curdling.\nIf you find that it's not as smooth as you'd like,\nyou can add a little bit of pasta water, like a 1/4 cup.\nBut ideally, it should look just like this.\nNow we're gonna taste for seasoning,\n(Mine needs a little bit of salt).\nThen you can optionally toss the pasta.\nThis is gonna help aerate it a little bit,\nget that sauce super creamy!\nAnd then, finally it's time to plate up!!\nI like to use a carving fork to twirl the\npasta into a giant cylinder like this one\nfor presentation on a long narrow plate.\nWe are then of course going to\nwant to top this Hedonistic Helix\nwith the remaining \"Guanciale\"\nfrom the bottom of the pan\nalong with any remnants of that creamy sauce!\nAnd there you have it folks!\nI'm going to say it one last time:\n\"Carbonara\",\nin its purest most authentic and traditional form.\nUnless of course I got something\nwrong, in which case I'm in trouble.\nBut at this point I'm gonna ask all Italians to leave\nthe room, because it's time to make carbonara.\nThis starts very much the same way\nwith Parmesan and Romano cheese\ngrated into a bowl along with\n3 eggs and 1 egg yolk,\nbeaten together with a few healthy\ntwists of freshly ground black pepper.\nNow when most Americans make\nCarbonara, they reach for the bacon.\nIf you can't find \"Guanciale\" or \"Pancetta\"\nand you got to use bacon,\njust go for the thick-cut stuff.\nAnd likewise we're gonna slice about\n1/2 a pound of it into big ol' chunks.\nThen likewise, we're gonna start\nthese guys off in a cold pan,\nbecause we want to render out as much fat\nas possible, but not for the same reason.\nYou'll also notice that I'm using a nonstick pan.\nAnd that's because in the stainless, bacon can leave\na lot of fond on the bottom of the pot.\nWhich for once we don't want, as it might\nmake our final pasta look kind of dirty.\nOnce the bacon is fully cooked and the fat\nrendered out, we are going to strain it.\nBecause this version of Carbonara\nis going to have a much lighter sauce.\nWe're just going to strain off all but\nabout 2 tbsp worth of bacon fat,\nwhich we're gonna leave in the pan.\nAnd then we're gonna return it over medium-low heat to\nadd the most egregious ingredient of all: garlic.\nThis is considered sacrilege\nin the world of \"Carbonara\",\nbut I think it tastes really\nreally good, and so will you.\nWe're just saut\u00e9ing for 1 minute\nuntil fragrant before killing the heat.\nNext up, I see far too many people just\ndump pasta out of the box in the water\nwhich inevitably leads to disaster.\nGive this a shot, where you dump\nthe pasta into the palm of your hand\nand then pull it out using\nyour hand, like a real gentleman.\nAnd as you can see, this time\nI'm going with Bucatini.\nNext up, just like last time we're adding\nthe pasta directly to the pan,\nbut this time we're gonna add about\n1/3 of a cup of starchy pasta water\nwhich is gonna help make a cohesive sauce.\nThen we are adding the egg\nand cheese mixture to the party.\nAnd if you find yourself in a pickle like this where\nyour pan is too small to toss the pasta, no biggie!\nJust dump it back into the emptied pasta pot.\nJust make sure that you keep it moving\nbecause there's a lot of residual heat in here\nand we don't want to end up with\npasta and scrambled eggs.\nSo just wildly agitate that around\nand then it's time to taste for seasoning!\nAdd salt and pepper as necessary\nand assess your sauce's thickness.\nIf it's not quite thick enough, you can rescue it\nwith a little bit of finely-grated Parmesan.\nJust add maybe another 1/4 oz\nor so and mix rigorously.\nAnd now it's time to plate up!!\nAnd one thing you'll notice about this Carbonara\nis that the sauce is much lighter\nbecause it has a lot less fat.\nIt also stays creamier longer and\nwon't congeal as quickly as \"Carbonara\".\nAnd the Bucatini, while a little bit difficult to\nget on one's fork, is dense and chewy and lovely.\nWhichever version of Carbonara\nyou decide to make for yourself,\nI hope this has shown you how easy it can be,\nso long as you follow a few simple tricks!\nNow go out there, get some pasta,\nand start rolling your R's."

for anything I can\nmake it right away now that my\npeppercorns have cooled I can crush them\nnow you could use a pepper grinder if\nyou want but I'm going to use the old\nclassic technique I get the pan I hold\nit down with my hand here body weight\ndown so I'm pushing and\nrolling almost like you're doing a lever\nright I'm pushing down on this side and\ncrushing my peppercorn and rolling so I\ncan smell as I Crush that these are\nsuper fragrant super nutty that toasting\nbrings out those flavors we get the oils\nout and I don't want this to be super\nfine I want it to have some texture to\nit we're talking about how to take this\ndish from just kind of a standard dish\nto just that much better and as a chef\ngrating your own cheese is super\nimportant for my carbonara I choose to\nuse two cheeses I'm using parmesan\ncheese and I'm using peino and I do buy\nthe good stuff for this I go to the\nItalian cheeses if you can get it go for\nthe best cheese you can find I like to\nuse a microplane for this now a\nmicroplane is a very fine greater when\nthis cheese melts I want it to be nice\nand fine I don't want to get shreds in\nthere I want to get this beautiful fine\ncheese that's going to make my sauce\nsuper silky in the end what I like about\nusing two cheeses here is the parmesan\ngives me a nice nuttiness and it gives\nme a really great kind of earthy flavor\nwhereas the peino is super sharp and\nit's got a lot of bite to it so look I\nhave a lot of cheese here and that's a\ngood thing that's what I want so this is\nfor about four servings now that my\ncheese is grated I can get to my eggs\nfor carbonara I like my eggs to be room\ntemperature so what I'll do is I'll set\nthem on the counter for about a half\nhour before I make the dish cuz if\nthey're cold that's going to slow\neverything down I'm going to put hot\npasta and cold eggs and the dish isn't\ngoing to come together and emulsify\nright so eggs are the binder for this\ndish this is what brings the whole thing\ntogether and I'm going to use three\nwhole eggs and two egg yolks and what I\nlike to do is crack my egg in half and\njust run my yolk between the shells\nuntil the white all runs out all away a\nlot of times people will just use\nstraight eggs for this and that's okay\nbut the yolk is a lot of fat and the\nwhite is a lot of liquid so by adding\nthe extra yolk I'm adding more fat to\nthe dish more richness to the dish the\nnext thing I'm going to do is I'm going\nto mix my eggs and cheese together and\nthis is a really important step because\nI want this to be a smooth and creamy\nsauce around my pasta we want to get\nthis into a nice homogeneous mixture so\nthat when we actually add the pasta to\nit we don't get scrambled eggs not a\ngood look for carbonara all right so\nlet's just take the cheese dump it into\nthe eggs and we can just get this\ntogether and you'll see it's going to\nget kind of like a a thick creamy\nmixture get that all in there I use a\nwhisk just to get this together but I'm\nnot going to use a whisk past this point\nbut you can\nsee the mixture looks nice and creamy\nit's come together there's no bits of\neggs or bits of cheese that aren't mixed\nin and that's what I want this is super\nimportant getting your carbonara to the\nright finished texture at this point I\nwant to add a little bit of my toasted\nblack pepper corns right give it a shake\nget a little bit of your finely ground\nstuff get a little bit of your bigger\nchunks so my egg and cheese mixture is\nready to go and now it's time for the\nstar of the show The Guan chal and this\nis super traditional for carbonara now\nif you don't have Guan chali if you\ncan't find it where you're at you can\nuse Panetta I've seen bacon be used\ntraditionally Guan chali is used for\ncarbonara and that's the jow or the\ncheek of the pig that's been cured salt\ncured sometimes they rub it in spices\nand sometimes in peppercorn but it's\njust cured it's salty it's fatty it's\ndelicious and that's why they use it it\nhas that fattiness when we cook it out\nwe get a lot of fat that helps make our\nsauce smooth and creamy so when it comes\nto gual I like nice big chunks of it so\nI like to cut my own I don't like to buy\na pre-cut so I want to get nice Max\nsticks or big mardones or chunks don't\nbe shy I want them to be\nsuper visible in my dish so you see I\nhave like kind of like this this match\nstick or a very thick match stick so\nwe're going to cut those into nice\nchunks I don't want any wimpy little\nchunks I want to see this Guan chal it's\na beautiful ingredient it's got some\nmeat on it but it's not super meting now\nthat I have my Guan chal cut my eggs\ncheese and pepper mixture we are ready\nto make our\ncarbonara you'll notice in front of me I\nhave all the ingredients I need within\narms re reach this is one of those\nthings as a chef that you have to set\nyourself up for it's proper me and pl my\nwater is boiling I'm going to add some\nsalt to my water I want my water to be\nbasically sea salty and I'm using uh dry\npasta it holds the sauce really well I\nlike to use spaghetti for this I like\nthe shape I like the way it holds on to\nthe sauce I like the bite to it pasta is\ngoing to take about 10 minutes and in\nthat time I'm going to get my Guan chali\nready to go so turn your heat on I like\nto use a little olive oil in my pan\nbefore I start cooking my Guan chal\npeople will say but chef Frank the Guan\nchali has a lot of fat I like to put\nthis in the pan to get the the process\ngoing quicker my gual is going to Brown\na little more evenly I don't really have\nto wait for that fat to render out so a\nlittle bit of fat in My Pan to start is\nthe way that I always go we're going to\ncook this until it is light golden brown\nyou can hear start to sizzle I don't\nwant this to be crisp I want it to have\nsome chew to it in the end so we're not\ngoing to Brown it all the way we want to\nkeep all the fat a lot of people say wo\nthat's a lot of fat we going to put that\nin the pasta yes we're using all the fat\nthe fat is key to this dish it's also\ngoing to emulsify with the egg yolks and\nmake this sauce super creamy don't\nforget to get in there and stir your\npasta occasionally we don't want it\nsticking well how do you tell if pasta\nis done if you look at it right now it's\nstill very firm right we want it to be\nnice and alente which means to the tooth\nwe don't want it to be overcooked we\nwant it to have a little bite to\nit my guali is ready to go you can see\nit's still bubbling away it's not\ncompletely done but if I leave it in the\npan and keep it hot it's going to\ncontinue to cook I don't want it to get\nany more crisp in this so I think my\npasta is ready the best way to determine\nif it is is to take a piece try not to\nburn yourself and actually taste it and\nthat's good to go a lot of people will\nmix carbonara in a pan and I don't like\ndoing it in a pan right pans retain heat\nI'm afraid my eggs might overcook and\nget scrambled so I like to mix\neverything in the bowl that I mix the\ncheese and eggs in so let's take our\npasta\nout right I drain it but I don't drain\nit too well we want to get a little bit\nof that pasta water in there the pasta\nwater has starch it has a little bit of\nsalt so this goes right into my eggs and\nthis is going to start that\nprocess of cooking those eggs and\nthen Wan chal and all the fat goes in\ndon't be shy and then we mix I have a\npair of tongs and here is the key here\nwe want to mix mix mix right we want\nthat egg and that cheese to start to\ncook we want that fat to be emulsified\ninto the\nsauce but look at that right super\ncreamy those eggs start to cook it\nsmells cheesy oh my gosh nice big chunks\nof the Guan chal which this is the\nimportant part here we're emulsifying\nthe sauce around the pasta all that fat\nfrom the Guan chal is getting in there\nand we get this beautiful luscious\ncreamy sauce look at that it's almost\nlike magic when this sauce comes\ntogether give it a little\ntwist I'm going to take some of my Guan\nchal put it on top right get some of\nthat creamy Guan chal from the bottom\nI'm going to take a little more of my\ntoasted black peppercorns and just a\nlittle more of my peino and parmesan\ncheese as if there wasn't enough already\nand that is foolproof\ncarbonara time to dig in I'm so excited\nthis is one of those dishes that uh\nwaits for no man woman or child you want\nto make sure you eat it while it's hot\nand ready to go make sure you get a\nlittle bit of everything in\nthere the sauce is silky and creamy cuz\nI took the time to get everything mixed\nreally well the Guan chali has some\nchuda it we get a little bit of\nspiciness from that black pepper corn\nand the mixture of BU cheeses sharp and\nkind of earthy I think makes this\ncarbonara one of the best versions\nyou'll ever\nhave it's not complicated takes a little\ntechnique a little bit of love and just\nmakes every part of you happy uh not\nonly your tummy but your soul as well\n[Music]"
