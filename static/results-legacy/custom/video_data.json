That might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin. For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder. It's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakery-style top. Sift it out. Give it a quick whisk and set it aside.",
        "explanation": "Combine all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Sift or whisk together to ensure even distribution. For variations, you may also add cocoa powder, spices, or other dry flavorings at this stage."

For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with room temperature things. If it gets cold, we're going to warm it up in the microwave. 300 ml or 1 1/4 cups of whole milk. Half a cup or 113 grams of unsalted butter that's been melted. Today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming. You wanna say hi? No, he's eating cookies that I made. One cup or 200 grams of sugar right in that bowl. Let's give it a whisk to bring it together. If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds and it should be totally fine. Two large eggs and one-quarter cup of sour cream. If you don't have that, you can use full-fat plain yogurt. This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla. Mix this up. If the butter turns into a mush, pop it into the microwave after whisking the eggs in.",

Some people prefer that nice crispy muffin edge, so if that's your preference, do it without the papers. Just be careful about adding enough butter and flour so they pop out easily. Use a large ice cream scooper to transfer the batter into the muffin tin. Fill it up all the way to the brim. Try to be careful about getting batter on the edges as it'll burn.
