### GOAL
You are given a list of information items. Provide a smallest list of applicability facets that can be used to differentiate all the provided information items (i.e., each semantically distinct item can be given a unique applicability signature across the facets). The facets should be:
- based on a single, concrete question about applicability of the information (why/when/where the information applies).
- orthogonal (the answer to one facet does not deterministically fix the answer to another).
- single-slot (the answer is one short phrase less than 3 words).

### PROCEDURE (iterate until stable)
1) Go over all the pairs of information items and check:
    a) if they are semantically similar, skip.
    b) if they are semantically distinct, try the following methods and pick the one that satisfy the main goal:
        - REUSE/EXTEND: See if the pair can be distinguished by at least one of the existing facets or by extending one of the existing facets; if necessary, refine the question to cover the distinction of the new pair.
        - ADD: Introduce exactly one new applicability facet (short facet title, question with less than 20 words, guidelines for the answer). The question should be about applicability of the information (why/when/where the information applies). The question should be single-slot (answerable with a short phrase less than 3 words) and orthogonal to others.
2) Check for orthogonality, single-slot, and "about applicability":
    - Check for orthogonality:
        - Redefine or replace non-orthogonal pairs with independent facets.  
        - Example (WRONG: not independent):  
            - [F3] In what place would this information be useful?  
            - [F4] What tools does this information apply to?
            - Tool applicability is deterministically tied to physical setting, so can focus on one of the two.
        - Example (CORRECT: independent redesign):  
            - [F4] What tools does this information apply to?
    - Check for single-slot:
        - Rephrase questions so answers fit in less than 3 words.
        - Example (WRONG: open-ended):  
            - [F5] Why does this information apply in this situation?  
        - Example (CORRECT: single-slot):  
            - [F5] What result/effect is this information trying to help achieve?
    - Check for "about applicability":
        - Ensure the question is about applicability of the information, not its description.
        - Example (WRONG: descriptive):  
                - [F6] Why pressing the button?
        - Example (CORRECT: applicability):  
                - [F6] What result/effect is this information trying to help achieve when pressing the button?

### OUTPUT
The list of APPLICABILITY FACETS, where each facet has the following fields:
- ID
- Type: Why | When | Where
- Title (less than 2-3 words)
- Plural title
- Question (less than 20 words)
- Guidelines on how to extract the answer from the information item/context (e.g., what to look for, what to ignore, format of the answer: length, how to canonize the answer)
- Example answers (1-2): short representative values 1-2 words

### NOTES
- Use domain-canonical labels/units. Try to ensure consistency in the format of the answers.
- Example answers are illustrative only, do not attempt completeness or invent unsupported values.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze procedural knowledge and its applicability.

ROLE: user

You are analyzing applicability facets (a single concrete question) that describe where knowledge about Making Muffins applies. There are three general types of facets: Why (e.g., why this information applies), When (e.g., when this information applies), Where (e.g., where this information applies).

### INPUTS
- Applicability facets, each labeled with an ID in square brackets (e.g., "[F1] ..."):  
[F1] (when) Stage (Plural: Stages)
Question formulation: At what stage of the recipe does this apply? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Pick a single short stage label describing timing relative to the main workflow.
- Use one word: prep (ingredient assembly before mixing), mixing (combining ingredients), baking (oven time), finishing (topping/serving), storage (refrigerate/cool).
- If instruction is about oven settings/timing, mark as baking. If about cooling/refrigerating, mark as storage.
- Ignore verbs/technique; focus only on when in the process it applies.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] mixing
Definition: Applies while combining ingredients into batter.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] baking
Definition: Applies during oven cooking steps.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F2] (where) Component (Plural: Components)
Question formulation: What component or part of the recipe does this apply to? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Choose one short label naming the target part: wet, dry, batter, topping, streusel, tins, oven, blueberries.
- Prefer broad canonical categories: wet (liquid/egg/milk/butter pool), dry (flour/sugar/powder), batter (combined mixture), topping (chips/streusel/extra), tins (muffin tray/liners), oven (temperature/settings).
- When instruction affects ingredients generally (e.g., 'all ingredients'), use batter if it's about the mixed result, otherwise use wet/dry accordingly.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] dry
Definition: Pertains to dry-ingredient preparation or additions (flour, cocoa, leaveners).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] topping
Definition: Pertains to adding or preparing surface toppings like chips or streusel.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F3] (why) Intent (Plural: Intents)
Question formulation: What result or effect is this instruction trying to achieve? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Pick one short intent: combine, aerate, leaven, flavor, measure, prepare, test, top, chill, bake.
- Map verbs to their goal: mixing/whisking/folding → combine or aerate (if explicitly whipping eggs); adding baking powder/soda → leaven; adding salt/vanilla → flavor; sifting/measure → measure; bake/test-doneness → test; refrigerate → chill.
- Choose the most specific single-word goal relevant to the instruction.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] combine
Definition: Goal is to bring ingredients together into a uniform mixture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] leaven
Definition: Goal is to introduce or enable rising (adding baking powder/soda, temperature step to encourage rise).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F4] (where) Tool (Plural: Tools)
Question formulation: What utensil/tool does this instruction apply to or require? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Answer with a single short tool name: whisk, mixer, spatula, sifter, scoop, oven, scoop, paper (liners).
- If the instruction names a utensil (whisk, electric mixer, spatula, sifter, ice-cream scoop), use that. If it is about oven settings, use oven. If none specified, answer 'none'.
- Normalize synonyms: 'electric mixer' or 'hand mixer' → mixer; 'large cookie scoop' or 'ice cream scoop' → scoop.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] whisk
Definition: Instruction requires or names a whisk for mixing.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] sifter
Definition: Instruction uses a sifter when adding dry ingredients.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F5] (why) Specificity (Plural: Specificities)
Question formulation: Does the item include precise measurement or temperature details? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Answer with one short value: specific or generic.
- Mark 'specific' if the instruction contains numeric quantities, weights, volumes, exact temps, or precise timing (e.g., '300 ml', '425°F', '20-25 minutes').
- Mark 'generic' if the step is procedural without exact amounts (e.g., 'whisk until combined', 'prepare the dry ingredients').
- Ignore subjective adjectives; only numeric/quantified specifics count.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] specific
Definition: Contains explicit measured quantities or exact temperatures/timings.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] generic
Definition: Describes an action or step without numeric measures.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F6] (why) Effect (Plural: Effects)
Question formulation: What result/effect does this information aim to achieve? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Look for phrases that state a goal, purpose or intended outcome (e.g., prevent, improve, fix, ensure, make).
- Map that purpose to a short canonical label of 1–2 words (e.g., "prevent sinking", canonicalize to "prevent-sink" -> but answers should be 1-2 words, use hyphenation only if needed).
- Prefer domain-canonical, outcome-focused labels: prevent-sink, prevent-stick, accuracy, consistency, even-distribute, fix-clumps, optional-top.
- Ignore procedural details (times, tools) when deciding the effect; focus on the stated/implicit goal.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] prevent-sink
Definition: Stops mix-ins (e.g., chocolate chips) from settling to the bottom during baking.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] accuracy
Definition: Improves measurement precision to get correct ingredient ratios.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F7] (when) Stage (Plural: Stages)
Question formulation: At what step/stage does this information apply? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Identify when the instruction is applied relative to the recipe flow: measurement, pre-mix, mixing, fixing (troubleshooting), topping, or pre-bake.
- Choose a single short canonical word/phrase (1–2 words) such as "measurement", "pre-mix", "mixing", "fix", "topping", "pre-bake".
- If the instruction is general or for the entire recipe (e.g., use room-temperature ingredients before you start), use "pre-mix".
- If it is a corrective action after a problem appears, use "fix".
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] measurement
Definition: Applies during the measuring step (weighing or measuring ingredients).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] topping
Definition: Applies at the final topping step before/after filling tins.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F8] (where) Target (Plural: Targets)
Question formulation: What component/item does this information apply to? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Extract the primary object or component the instruction is about (e.g., chocolate chips, flour, butter, cups, scale, ingredients, blueberries, batter).
- Provide a concise canonical label of 1–2 words: "chips", "flour", "butter", "cups", "scale", "ingredients", "blueberries", "batter".
- Ignore secondary objects that are only mentioned as context; choose the principal target of the action or applicability.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] chips
Definition: Applies specifically to mix-ins like chocolate chips.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] scale
Definition: Applies to the measuring tool (weighing scale) or the act of weighing.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F9] (why) Result (Plural: Results)
Question formulation: What result/effect does this information aim to achieve? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Look for the intended outcome or problem addressed (shape, texture, distribution, rise control, etc.).
- Ignore procedural steps or timing language; focus on the effect the tip is trying to produce.
- Answer must be a short canonical label (≤2 words). Use these canonical values when applicable: shape, texture, distribution, rise-control.
- If multiple effects are mentioned, pick the primary/explicit effect in the sentence.
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] shape
Definition: Changes to muffin geometry (doming, spreading, edges).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] texture
Definition: Changes to crumb quality or fluffiness.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```
[F10] (when) Stage (Plural: Stages)
Question formulation: When in the muffin process does this apply? 
Answer guidelines: ```
- Identify the procedural phase the tip applies to (mixing, ingredient prep, chilling, or oven settings/stages).
- Ignore the ultimate effect; focus on timing or step referenced (e.g., before baking, during mixing, at oven start).
- Answer must be a short canonical label (≤2 words). Use these canonical values when applicable: mixing, ingredient-prep, chill, oven-start, oven-temp.
- If the advice refers to how to treat an ingredient (e.g., toss blueberries in flour), use ingredient-prep; if it refers to chilling batter, use chill; oven behavior separate into oven-start (high initial heat) vs oven-temp (general oven temperature).
```
Example answers: ```
[A1] chill
Definition: Applied by refrigerating batter before baking (pre-bake refrigeration).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] oven-start
Definition: Applied at the start of baking (a high initial heat blast to set edges).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
```

### GOAL
Combine the given facets to get a set of facets that:
- Cover all initial facets.
- Are orthogonal (the answer to one facet does not deterministically fix the answer to another).
- Are about applicability (the question concerns when/where/why a piece of information about the task applies).
- Are single-slot (the answer is one short phrase <3 words).

### PROCEDURE
Iterate until stable:
1) Check for duplicates:
    - Merge semantically equivalent facets.  
    - Example (WRONG: treated separately):  
        - [F1] What phase does this information apply?  
        - [F2] What time in the process does this information apply?  
    - Example (CORRECT: merged):  
        - [F1] What phase does this information apply?  
2) Check for orthogonality:
    - Redefine or replace non-orthogonal pairs with independent facets.  
    - Example (WRONG: not independent):  
        - [F3] In what place would this information be useful?  
        - [F4] What tools does this information apply to?
        - Tool applicability is deterministically tied to physical setting, so can focus on one of the two.
    - Example (CORRECT: independent redesign):  
        - [F4] What tools does this information apply to?
3) Check for single-slot:
    - Rephrase questions so answers fit in less than 3 words.
    - Example (WRONG: open-ended):  
        - [F5] Why does this information apply in this situation?  
    - Example (CORRECT: single-slot):  
        - [F5] What result/effect is this information trying to help achieve?
4) Check for "about applicability":
   - Ensure the question is about applicability of the information, not its description.
   - Example (WRONG: descriptive):  
        - [F6] Why pressing the button?
   - Example (CORRECT: applicability):  
        - [F6] What result/effect is this information trying to help achieve when pressing the button?
5) Check for coverage:
    - Ensure the new set preserves all the meaning of the original facets.

### EXIT CONDITION
The final facet set is smallest, orthogonal, single-slot, and fully covers the initial set. The facets should be about applicability of the information.

### OUTPUT
The list of APPLICABILITY FACETS, where each facet has the following fields:
- ID
- Type: Why | When | Where
- Title (less than 2-3 words)
- Plural title
- Question (less than 20 words)
- Guidelines on how to extract the answer from the information item/context (e.g., what to look for, what to ignore, format of the answer: length, how to canonize the answer)
- Example answers (1-2): short representative values 1-2 words

### NOTES
- Use domain-canonical labels/units.
- Example answers are illustrative, not exhaustive.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are updating a codebook for the Stage facet of Making Muffins. 
A "Stage" is defined as a canonical answer to the question: "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?".

### INPUTS
- Existing canonical Stages:
[A1] mixing
Definition: Applies while combining ingredients into batter.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] baking
Definition: Applies during oven cooking steps.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick a single short stage label describing timing relative to the main workflow.
- Use 1–2 words: ingredient-prep (preparing individual ingredients, e.g., toss blueberries in flour), measurement (weighing/measuring), mixing (combining wet/dry into batter), pre-bake (final steps before oven like filling tins/topping), baking (oven time; includes oven-start/high-heat at beginning), finishing (cooling/serving/topping after bake), storage (refrigerate/cool/keep).
- If instruction is about oven settings or timing, prefer baking or oven-start if it's specifically about an initial blast of heat.
- If instruction is about refrigerating or cooling, use storage. If it is about ingredient temperature or 'use room-temperature eggs before starting', use ingredient-prep.
- Answer must be one short canonical label (≤2 words).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Stage if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Stage if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Stage that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Stage in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Stage is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Stage
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.

[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick a single short stage label describing timing relative to the main workflow.
- Use 1–2 words: ingredient-prep (preparing individual ingredients, e.g., toss blueberries in flour), measurement (weighing/measuring), mixing (combining wet/dry into batter), pre-bake (final steps before oven like filling tins/topping), baking (oven time; includes oven-start/high-heat at beginning), finishing (cooling/serving/topping after bake), storage (refrigerate/cool/keep).
- If instruction is about oven settings or timing, prefer baking or oven-start if it's specifically about an initial blast of heat.
- If instruction is about refrigerating or cooling, use storage. If it is about ingredient temperature or 'use room-temperature eggs before starting', use ingredient-prep.
- Answer must be one short canonical label (≤2 words).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Stage if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Stage if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Stage that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Stage in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Stage is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Stage
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick a single short stage label describing timing relative to the main workflow.
- Use 1–2 words: ingredient-prep (preparing individual ingredients, e.g., toss blueberries in flour), measurement (weighing/measuring), mixing (combining wet/dry into batter), pre-bake (final steps before oven like filling tins/topping), baking (oven time; includes oven-start/high-heat at beginning), finishing (cooling/serving/topping after bake), storage (refrigerate/cool/keep).
- If instruction is about oven settings or timing, prefer baking or oven-start if it's specifically about an initial blast of heat.
- If instruction is about refrigerating or cooling, use storage. If it is about ingredient temperature or 'use room-temperature eggs before starting', use ingredient-prep.
- Answer must be one short canonical label (≤2 words).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Stage if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Stage if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Stage that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Stage in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Stage is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Stage
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Stages (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick a single short stage label describing timing relative to the main workflow.
- Use 1–2 words: ingredient-prep (preparing individual ingredients, e.g., toss blueberries in flour), measurement (weighing/measuring), mixing (combining wet/dry into batter), pre-bake (final steps before oven like filling tins/topping), baking (oven time; includes oven-start/high-heat at beginning), finishing (cooling/serving/topping after bake), storage (refrigerate/cool/keep).
- If instruction is about oven settings or timing, prefer baking or oven-start if it's specifically about an initial blast of heat.
- If instruction is about refrigerating or cooling, use storage. If it is about ingredient temperature or 'use room-temperature eggs before starting', use ingredient-prep.
- Answer must be one short canonical label (≤2 words).

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Stage if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "At what stage of the recipe does this apply?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Stage if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Stage that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Stage in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Stage is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Stage
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

You are updating a codebook for the Target facet of Making Muffins. 
A "Target" is defined as a canonical answer to the question: "What component or item does this apply to?".

### INPUTS
- Existing canonical Targets:
[A1] dry
Definition: Pertains to dry-ingredient preparation or additions (flour, sugar, leaveners).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] chips
Definition: Applies specifically to mix-ins like chocolate chips.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Targets (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Choose the primary component or object the instruction affects (1–2 words).
- Canonical labels to prefer: wet, dry, batter, topping, streusel, chips, blueberries, flour, butter, tins, oven, ingredients, mix-ins.
- If instruction affects the assembled mixture generally, use batter. If it addresses ingredients individually, choose wet or dry as appropriate. If it targets a tool or appliance (oven, tins), use that label.
- Ignore secondary/context objects; pick the principal target.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Target if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What component or item does this apply to?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What component or item does this apply to?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Target if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Target that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Target in the final list (existing or new):

    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Target is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Target
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Targets (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Choose the primary component or object the instruction affects (1–2 words).
- Canonical labels to prefer: wet, dry, batter, topping, streusel, chips, blueberries, flour, butter, tins, oven, ingredients, mix-ins.
- If instruction affects the assembled mixture generally, use batter. If it addresses ingredients individually, choose wet or dry as appropriate. If it targets a tool or appliance (oven, tins), use that label.
- Ignore secondary/context objects; pick the principal target.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Target if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What component or item does this apply to?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What component or item does this apply to?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Target if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Target that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Target in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Target is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Target
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

[531 - 533] We'll see you later.    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Targets (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Choose the primary component or object the instruction affects (1–2 words).
- Canonical labels to prefer: wet, dry, batter, topping, streusel, chips, blueberries, flour, butter, tins, oven, ingredients, mix-ins.
- If instruction affects the assembled mixture generally, use batter. If it addresses ingredients individually, choose wet or dry as appropriate. If it targets a tool or appliance (oven, tins), use that label.
- Ignore secondary/context objects; pick the principal target.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Target if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What component or item does this apply to?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What component or item does this apply to?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Target if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Target that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Target in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Target is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Target
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are updating a codebook for the Tool facet of Making Muffins. 
A "Tool" is defined as a canonical answer to the question: "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?".

### INPUTS
- Existing canonical Tools:
[A1] whisk
Definition: Instruction requires or names a whisk.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] scoop
Definition: Uses a scoop (e.g., ice-cream or cookie scoop) to portion batter.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Tools (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Answer with a single short tool name (1 word) or 'none' if no tool is specified.
- Normalize synonyms: 'hand mixer' or 'electric mixer' → mixer; 'ice-cream scoop' → scoop; 'paper liners' → paper; 'muffin tray' → tins.
- If the instruction names a specific utensil, use that normalized label. If it concerns oven settings, use oven.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Tool if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Tool if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Tool that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Tool in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Tools (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Answer with a single short tool name (1 word) or 'none' if no tool is specified.
- Normalize synonyms: 'hand mixer' or 'electric mixer' → mixer; 'ice-cream scoop' → scoop; 'paper liners' → paper; 'muffin tray' → tins.
- If the instruction names a specific utensil, use that normalized label. If it concerns oven settings, use oven.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Tool if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Tool if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Tool that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Tool in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Tool is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Tool
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Tools (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Answer with a single short tool name (1 word) or 'none' if no tool is specified.
- Normalize synonyms: 'hand mixer' or 'electric mixer' → mixer; 'ice-cream scoop' → scoop; 'paper liners' → paper; 'muffin tray' → tins.
- If the instruction names a specific utensil, use that normalized label. If it concerns oven settings, use oven.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Tool if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Tool if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Tool that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Tool in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Tool is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Tool
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Tools (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Answer with a single short tool name (1 word) or 'none' if no tool is specified.
- Normalize synonyms: 'hand mixer' or 'electric mixer' → mixer; 'ice-cream scoop' → scoop; 'paper liners' → paper; 'muffin tray' → tins.
- If the instruction names a specific utensil, use that normalized label. If it concerns oven settings, use oven.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Tool if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What utensil or tool does this instruction require or apply to?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Tool if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Tool that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Tool in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Tool is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Tool
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are updating a codebook for the Intent facet of Making Muffins. 
A "Intent" is defined as a canonical answer to the question: "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?".

### INPUTS
- Existing canonical Intents:
[A1] combine
Definition: Goal is to bring ingredients together into a uniform mixture.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] leaven
Definition: Goal is to introduce or enable rising (adding baking powder/soda).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Intents (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick one short intent word (1 word) representing the action goal: combine, aerate, leaven, flavor, measure, prepare, test, top, chill, bake, fold.
- Map verbs to their goal: mixing/whisking/folding → combine or aerate (choose aerate if explicitly whipping to add air); adding baking powder/soda → leaven; adding salt/vanilla → flavor; sifting/measure → measure; refrigerate → chill; testing doneness → test; adding topping → top.
- Choose the most specific single-word intent relevant to the instruction.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Intent if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Intent if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Intent that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Intent in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Intents (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick one short intent word (1 word) representing the action goal: combine, aerate, leaven, flavor, measure, prepare, test, top, chill, bake, fold.
- Map verbs to their goal: mixing/whisking/folding → combine or aerate (choose aerate if explicitly whipping to add air); adding baking powder/soda → leaven; adding salt/vanilla → flavor; sifting/measure → measure; refrigerate → chill; testing doneness → test; adding topping → top.
- Choose the most specific single-word intent relevant to the instruction.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Intent if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Intent if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Intent that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Intent in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Intent is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Intent
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Intents (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick one short intent word (1 word) representing the action goal: combine, aerate, leaven, flavor, measure, prepare, test, top, chill, bake, fold.
- Map verbs to their goal: mixing/whisking/folding → combine or aerate (choose aerate if explicitly whipping to add air); adding baking powder/soda → leaven; adding salt/vanilla → flavor; sifting/measure → measure; refrigerate → chill; testing doneness → test; adding topping → top.
- Choose the most specific single-word intent relevant to the instruction.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Intent if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Intent if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Intent that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Intent in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Intent is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Intent
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Intents (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Pick one short intent word (1 word) representing the action goal: combine, aerate, leaven, flavor, measure, prepare, test, top, chill, bake, fold.
- Map verbs to their goal: mixing/whisking/folding → combine or aerate (choose aerate if explicitly whipping to add air); adding baking powder/soda → leaven; adding salt/vanilla → flavor; sifting/measure → measure; refrigerate → chill; testing doneness → test; adding topping → top.
- Choose the most specific single-word intent relevant to the instruction.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Intent if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What action-based goal is this instruction trying to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Intent if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Intent that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Intent in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Intent is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Intent
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

MESSAGES: ROLE: system

You are a helpful assistant who can understand and analyze tutorial videos.
ROLE: user

You are updating a codebook for the Effect facet of Making Muffins. 
A "Effect" is defined as a canonical answer to the question: "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?".

### INPUTS
- Existing canonical Effects:
[A1] prevent-sink
Definition: Stops mix-ins from settling to the bottom during baking.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
[A2] texture
Definition: Affects crumb quality or fluffiness.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
No examples contents and context are available.
```
- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Effects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Select a short outcome label (1–2 words) describing the purpose or problem addressed: texture, shape, distribution, prevent-sink, prevent-stick, accuracy, consistency, even-distribute, fix-clumps, optional-top.
- Look for stated or implied goals (e.g., 'so chips don't sink' → prevent-sink; 'for a light crumb' → texture).
- Ignore procedural details when deciding the effect; focus on the aim or problem being solved.
- Answer should be concise and outcome-focused.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Effect if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Effect if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Effect that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Effect in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Effect is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Effect
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.

[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Effects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Select a short outcome label (1–2 words) describing the purpose or problem addressed: texture, shape, distribution, prevent-sink, prevent-stick, accuracy, consistency, even-distribute, fix-clumps, optional-top.
- Look for stated or implied goals (e.g., 'so chips don't sink' → prevent-sink; 'for a light crumb' → texture).
- Ignore procedural details when deciding the effect; focus on the aim or problem being solved.
- Answer should be concise and outcome-focused.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Effect if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Effect if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Effect that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Effect in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Effect is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Effect
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Select a short outcome label (1–2 words) describing the purpose or problem addressed: texture, shape, distribution, prevent-sink, prevent-stick, accuracy, consistency, even-distribute, fix-clumps, optional-top.
- Look for stated or implied goals (e.g., 'so chips don't sink' → prevent-sink; 'for a light crumb' → texture).
- Ignore procedural details when deciding the effect; focus on the aim or problem being solved.
- Answer should be concise and outcome-focused.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Effect if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Effect if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Effect that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Effect in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Effect is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Effects (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Select a short outcome label (1–2 words) describing the purpose or problem addressed: texture, shape, distribution, prevent-sink, prevent-stick, accuracy, consistency, even-distribute, fix-clumps, optional-top.
- Look for stated or implied goals (e.g., 'so chips don't sink' → prevent-sink; 'for a light crumb' → texture).
- Ignore procedural details when deciding the effect; focus on the aim or problem being solved.
- Answer should be concise and outcome-focused.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Effect if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Effect if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Effect that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Effect in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Effect is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Effect
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 4] Now that I've successfully learnt how to make muffins, I had to make a triple chocolate version.
[4 - 7] Add all the wet ingredients to a bowl and whisk until combined.
[7 - 10] In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa powder and caster sugar and whisk these together.
[10 - 12] Then add your chocolate chips.
[12 - 14] Coating them in the flour helps stop them from sinking.
[14 - 17] Fold the wet ingredients into the mix, then refrigerate for at least one hour.
[17 - 19] This helps them rise without overflowing.
[19 - 23] Scoop the batter into muffin cases, then top with a mix of chocolate chips.
[23 - 25] Follow these baking instructions and that's it.
[25 - 25] Enjoy!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Specificities (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Answer with one word: specific or generic.
- Mark 'specific' if the text contains numeric quantities, weights, volumes, exact temperatures, or precise timings (e.g., '300 ml', '425°F', '20 minutes').
- Mark 'generic' if the instruction is procedural without exact amounts (e.g., 'mix until combined', 'preheat the oven').
- Ignore subjective adjectives; only numeric or explicitly quantified details count.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Specificity if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "Does the instruction include precise measurements or temperatures?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "Does the instruction include precise measurements or temperatures?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Specificity if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Specificity that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Specificity in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Specificity is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Specificity
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

- Tutorial-style transcript with timestamps (in seconds):
[0 - 6] Do you love moist, fluffy chocolate chip muffins with that skyhigh bakery top and a nice crisp edge?
[6 - 9] Well, today's your lucky day because I'm gonna show you how to make them.
[9 - 14] Hey, you're watching Preppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends.
[14 - 17] These chocolate chip muffins are gonna whip up in a snap, so let's get started.
[17 - 21] First off, set that oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21 - 31] We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
[31 - 36] If you did 350, they would spread out and it just wouldn't be the right kind of muffin.
[36 - 38] Okay, now for the dry ingredients.
[38 - 46] I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
[46 - 49] It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly.
[50 - 54] It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
[55 - 57] Okay, into my bowl, and I'm using a sifter here.
[57 - 64] I'm adding in two and 3 14 cups, that is 330 grams, of allpurpose flour.
[65 - 76] One teaspoon of salt, and that might seem like a lot, but you want some contrast to all that chocolate and the sugar, so it'll really like amp the flavor up and let you appreciate what's going on in the muffin.
[76 - 85] For leavening, I'm using one tablespoon of baking powder, and again, it's kind of a lot of leavening agent, but this is how you get that bakerystyle top.
[85 - 86] Sift it out.
[87 - 90] We're done with that scale, you can set it aside as well.
[90 - 94] Give it a quick whisk, and now we can set it aside.
[94 - 96] This was melted a minute ago.
[96 - 98] It already cooled down, I'm gonna put it into the microwave.
[100 - 108] For the wet ingredients, it's important that you're dealing with roomtemperature things, and if it gets cold, we're gonna warm it up in the microwave, and P.S., it's gonna get cold.
[108 - 109] This counter's freezing.
[110 - 114] All right, 300 ml, or 1 14 cups, of whole milk.
[114 - 115] In you go.
[115 - 121] Half a cup, or 113 grams, of unsalted butter that's been melted, and get it all out there.
[121 - 128] So, by the by, today is the first time ever in the history of Preppy Kitchen that Brian is filming.
[128 - 129] You wanna say hi?
[130 - 132] He's eating cookies that I made.
[132 - 137] One cup, or 200 grams, of sugar right in that bowl.
[137 - 140] Let's give it a little whisk to bring it together.
[140 - 148] If you notice some clumps of butter happen when you mix it all together, pop it into the microwave for 40 seconds, and it should be totally fine.
[148 - 150] I used warm milk, so it's not happening to me.
[150 - 153] So right now, we're gonna add in the eggs and the sour cream.
[153 - 162] Two large eggs, one, two, as well as 1 14 cup of sour cream, and if you don't have that, you can go ahead and use fullfat plain yogurt.
[162 - 164] It'll be completely delicious still.
[164 - 168] This is optional, but I am adding one tablespoon of vanilla.
[168 - 170] That's 15 ml.
[170 - 172] Wow, delicious.
[173 - 178] I'm gonna mix this up right now, but look what's happened just in the few seconds that we've been doing this.
[178 - 180] What's going on here?
[180 - 184] Look, it's turned into like a butter mush.
[184 - 188] That's not what I want, so I will be popping this into the microwave after I whisk the eggs in.
[188 - 192] You don't wanna do that before the eggs get whisked in, because they could be overcooked.
[194 - 196] A little heat's gonna fix all of our problems.
[196 - 197] Okay, a little bit of heat later.
[197 - 199] Let's give this a whisk.
[199 - 200] That's nice.
[200 - 203] Nice, homogenous, fluid mixture is what we want.
[203 - 209] Now it's time to pour the wet into the dry, give it a whisk, and take it to almost combined.
[209 - 216] You could have a couple clumps of flour hanging out here and there, because we'll do more mixing once those chocolate chips go in.
[217 - 220] So you can see we have a couple clumps here and there, but it's no big deal.
[221 - 224] It's time for some chocolate, the best part.
[224 - 233] All right, in my recipe, I specify 1 12 cups of semisweet chocolate, but I'm living large and using one cup of semisweet and half a cup of bittersweet.
[234 - 237] You could even use milk chocolate if that's what you prefer.
[237 - 238] There we go.
[238 - 248] That's the bittersweet chocolate, and I'm taking a handful of the semisweet chips and reserving them, because I'll be sprinkling them on top for beauty purposes.
[248 - 254] Rest of the chocolate chips go in, and you should fold them in with a spatula, not use a whisk.
[254 - 258] After those chocolate chips are folded in, it's time to pop this into the muffin tins.
[259 - 264] I'm doing it two different ways so you can see the difference between a naked muffin and one that's in the paper.
[264 - 266] It's gonna be different.
[266 - 277] I've buttered and floured half of the muffin tins so you can see just a nice coat of butter, good dash of flour, move all that flour around, and then dump out the excess.
[277 - 287] All right, and for the rest, I'm gonna use muffin papers, which go a bit higher, so you won't have that mushroomshaped muffin top, but they should still rise up with a nice dome.
[288 - 289] In you go.
[289 - 296] Unlike with cakes, some people really prefer that nice, crispy muffin edge, so if that's your jam, then you're gonna wanna do it without the papers.
[296 - 300] Just really be careful about adding in enough butter and flour so they pop out easily.
[300 - 307] I'm using a large ice cream scooper to transfer my batter into the muffin tin, and I wanna fill it up all the way.
[307 - 312] Normally, it's 2 13 of the way high for cupcakes, but this time, it's full to the brim.
[312 - 318] Okay, fill those papers up, and when you're doing that, try to be careful about getting batter on the edges.
[318 - 319] It'll burn.
[319 - 320] It's just a matter of how it looks.
[320 - 322] It'll still bake fine.
[322 - 329] When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount.
[329 - 335] You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
[335 - 341] After the batter goes in, you can top the muffins with a scattering of chocolate chips.
[341 - 349] This is not super necessary, but it'll give you nice, glossy, melty chocolate tops, and it makes a big difference.
[349 - 353] The chocolate chip muffins look a little bit naked if they don't have those chocolate chips on top.
[353 - 359] Okay, this recipe makes exactly 12 big muffins, and now it's time to go into the oven.
[359 - 368] You need to have a high heat to lock in the edge so it gets set, and then the top can burst through to create that big bakerystyle dome.
[368 - 386] This is gonna go into the oven at 425 Fahrenheit for five minutes, then it'll reduce the temperature to 350 and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, depending, you wanna have a nice golden top that's set in the middle, so you can insert a skewer through the center, it'll come out clean except for all that molten chocolate.
[386 - 388] Right, into the oven you go.
[388 - 395] Out of the oven and cooled just enough to touch, I wanna show you the difference between the in paper versus the out of paper.
[395 - 402] Out of paper, so nice, crisp edge, muffined over a little bit, and golden brown.
[402 - 411] In the paper, the paper really guided it up so it's a little bit taller, and the difference is that you don't have that crisp edge.
[411 - 415] It's really like soft all over and just delicious.
[415 - 417] You've gotta take a look at the inside of this.
[417 - 418] Take a look.
[418 - 421] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[421 - 424] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[424 - 427] Someone's making crazy faces behind the camera.
[427 - 429] If you like this video, check out my chocolate playlist.
[429 - 433] It has all my favorite chocolate recipes and they are amazingly delicious.
[433 - 435] You've gotta check it out.
[435 - 437] Now it's time for a bite.
[437 - 439] Oh my gosh, do you see how crazy this is?
[442 - 445] Oh my God, that is so good, so perfect.

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Specificities (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Answer with one word: specific or generic.
- Mark 'specific' if the text contains numeric quantities, weights, volumes, exact temperatures, or precise timings (e.g., '300 ml', '425°F', '20 minutes').
- Mark 'generic' if the instruction is procedural without exact amounts (e.g., 'mix until combined', 'preheat the oven').
- Ignore subjective adjectives; only numeric or explicitly quantified details count.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Specificity if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "Does the instruction include precise measurements or temperatures?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "Does the instruction include precise measurements or temperatures?".
2) For each span:

[0 - 7] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
[7 - 13] They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
[13 - 17] So you want to start off by combining all of your dry ingredients.
[17 - 26] So in a large bowl, combine two cups of allpurpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.
[26 - 31] Then whisk it all together and reserve one tablespoon of that flour mixture.
[34 - 39] Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries.
[39 - 44] The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
[44 - 48] During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
[48 - 52] Now add three eggs into a large bowl and whisk them on high speed using an electric mixer.
[52 - 57] So you'll want to do this for about three minutes until the eggs become fluffy and pale.
[58 - 62] Then continue beating the eggs as you slowly add one cup of granulated sugar.
[65 - 68] You'll want to keep beating those eggs for about three more minutes.
[68 - 72] So the key to really fluffy muffins is wellbeaten eggs.
[72 - 79] Now you want to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice.
[79 - 86] Now continue beating the egg mixture as you slowly add three quarter cups of heavy cream.
[86 - 92] Now you can begin adding your dry ingredients, but don't do it all at once.
[93 - 98] So get a sifter out and then add about a third of that flour mixture at a time with mixing in between.
[106 - 124] So once you've got all of your dry ingredients well combined into the muffin batter, continue beating with your electric mixer as you slowly, gradually add in four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter.
[130 - 133] All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries.
[133 - 136] And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula.
[136 - 142] Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
[142 - 148] I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
[148 - 152] Now before the muffins go into the oven, you want to make that simple streusel.
[152 - 165] In a small bowl, combine one tablespoon of unsalted cold cube butter, two tablespoons of allpurpose flour, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and three tablespoons of brown sugar.
[165 - 173] Mash that all together using a fork until the ingredients are well combined and they have a crumbly texture to them.
[173 - 187] Now top the blueberry muffins with the streusel topping and bake them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.
[187 - 200] I hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you did, please be sure to share, like, and subscribe to our channel so you guys never miss out on any of our new recipes.
[200 - 208] See you next time!    

### GOAL
Return an updated list of canonical Specificities (including existing and any new ones needed to cover the given transcript), each with 1-2 concrete examples grounded in the given transcript (or reused from the existing list if not found in the transcript).

### GUIDELINES FOR CANONICAL ANSWERS:
- Answer with one word: specific or generic.
- Mark 'specific' if the text contains numeric quantities, weights, volumes, exact temperatures, or precise timings (e.g., '300 ml', '425°F', '20 minutes').
- Mark 'generic' if the instruction is procedural without exact amounts (e.g., 'mix until combined', 'preheat the oven').
- Ignore subjective adjectives; only numeric or explicitly quantified details count.

### GENERAL NORMALIZATION RULES (apply in addition to the above):
- Merge synonyms/variants into one canonical value; keep the existing value as the canonical form when applicable.
- Use concise, unambiguous phrasing; avoid brand-specific or overly narrow wording unless essential to task fidelity.
- Only add a new Specificity if the transcript clearly contains an answer to "Does the instruction include precise measurements or temperatures?" that is not covered by any existing canonical value.

### PROCEDURE
1) Scan the transcript for spans that directly answer "Does the instruction include precise measurements or temperatures?".
2) For each span:
    - Map it to an existing canonical Specificity if it's the same concept (consider synonyms, pluralization, formatting).
    - If no existing value fits, propose a new canonical Specificity that follows the guidelines.
3) For every canonical Specificity in the final list (existing or new):
    - Provide 1-2 representative examples.
    - Each example must include:
        - content (the exact minimal excerpt that supports the answer)
        - context (around 10-20 words surrounding the content and the content itself)
    - If a canonical Specificity is not evidenced in the given transcript, reuse one example from the existing list if available.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of canonical answers. Each answer should have the following fields:
- id: id of the canonical Specificity
- answer: short representative value less than 2-3 words
- definition: elaboration of what the answer means
- examples: 1-2 short representative content and context that would be labeled as the answer

NOTES
- Ground everything in the provided inputs; no external knowledge or speculation.
- Do not create duplicate or overlapping canonical values.
- Keep examples short and specific; avoid paraphrasing for the 'content' field.

[0 - 4] Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you my Master Muffin Recipe.
[4 - 14] Instead of giving you dozens of recipes for different flavors of muffins, today I'm sharing my Master Muffin Recipe, which you can use to make almost any flavor, and it's super easy.
[14 - 18] Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
[18 - 23] Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups.
[23 - 30] Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins from sticking.
[30 - 32] Now it's time to put together our batter.
[32 - 42] First I'm going to demonstrate a basic muffin batter, and then I'm going to show you 5 different variations, each demonstrating a different way that you can build upon the base recipe.
[42 - 48] The batter starts with 1 cup of softened salted butter, and 1 cup of granulated sugar.
[48 - 50] We're going to use a hand mixer to cream this together.
[51 - 55] At first this mixture will be lumpy, but keep on mixing for about 2 minutes.
[56 - 63] After 2 minutes your sugar and butter will be well combined, and it will be a smooth paste like creamy consistency.
[63 - 69] Then you'll add in 2 large eggs and mix this briefly until just combined, about 30 seconds.
[70 - 81] Then I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or you can use other flavors of extract like almond extract, orange extract, lemon extract, those are all super popular options.
[82 - 90] For the lemon and citrus extracts I recommend only using 1 teaspoon of those, and combining that with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
[90 - 95] You'll also need 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.
[95 - 101] This is also the point where you'd add in any spices like cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.
[101 - 105] We're going to give this a quick mix just to combine about 10 seconds.
[106 - 111] Now at this point it's time to ditch our hand mixer and grab a rubber spatula.
[111 - 113] Add in 1 half of your allpurpose flour.
[113 - 116] You're going to use 2 cups total, so you're going to add in 1 cup right now.
[116 - 119] Then use the rubber spatula to stir this in.
[119 - 125] Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk.
[125 - 133] Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
[133 - 137] Last you'll add in the remaining 1 cup of allpurpose flour.
[137 - 142] Stir this together, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure that everything gets mixed in.
[142 - 150] Now if you're going to add anything into your muffins, like dried fruit, chocolate chips, or berries, now would be the time to do so, but I'll show you that in just a minute.
[150 - 153] Your batter should be thick but also spreadable.
[153 - 160] We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full.
[160 - 169] It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
[169 - 181] You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches.
[181 - 185] Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes.
[185 - 191] After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
[191 - 199] Continue baking for 1215 minutes and watch them carefully, as the cooking time will vary a little bit depending on your oven.
[199 - 204] Now let's start going over some variations, starting with a lemon blueberry muffin.
[204 - 209] This is great because it demonstrates both using another flavor of extract, as well as adding in fresh fruit.
[210 - 221] I've already creamed together the sugar and butter and added in the eggs, so now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon of lemon extract before adding in my baking powder and salt.
[221 - 232] Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too.
[233 - 240] Then this is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
[240 - 241] Then simply fold this in.
[242 - 248] Then it's just a matter of once again dividing the batter evenly amongst the 12 muffin cups.
[248 - 255] One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins.
[255 - 257] This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
[257 - 260] And then of course bake these just as we did before.
[260 - 263] Next up I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate version.
[263 - 274] For a chocolate version you'll use your butter and sugar again just like before, but this time you'll add in 1 12 cup of cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, and cream that in with it.
[274 - 284] From here you'll proceed with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in eggs, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, all purpose flour, and milk or buttermilk.
[284 - 289] The addition of the cocoa powder really doesn't do much to change the texture of the final batter.
[289 - 294] Then just for fun I'm going to add in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and fold those in.
[295 - 304] Even though you can mix and match addins, you want to total any additions that you make, like chocolate chips or nuts or dried fruit, to 1 cup total.
[304 - 312] Next I'm going to show you one of my very favorite muffin hacks that allows you to switch up with all sorts of different flavors by using instant pudding.
[312 - 328] This time you're only going to add in 34 cup of granulated sugar, because you're going to replace that additional 14 cup with a 3.4 ounce package of instant pudding mix, and this time I'm using pistachio because it's one of my favorite flavors.
[328 - 332] Cream this together and then proceed with the master muffin recipe as directed.
[333 - 337] You could even fold in some chopped pistachios if you wanted.
[337 - 349] This variation is fun because there's just so many different flavors of instant pudding out there, it makes it really easy to mix and match flavors really quickly without having to buy a bunch of extracts.
[349 - 357] Next I want to show just how easy it is to mix and match addins to add a little bit of flavor to the base recipe without too much hassle.
[357 - 363] So I'm going to show you a cranberry white chocolate chip with a little bit of orange zest.
[363 - 367] This is the master recipe with no alterations to it.
[367 - 374] I'm going to add in 12 cup of dried cranberries, because like I said before we're going to use 1 cup of addins total.
[374 - 380] That means that the white chocolate chips will also come in at 12 cup for 1 cup total.
[380 - 389] I didn't have any orange extract today, but that's okay because a little bit of orange zest, 12 tablespoons total, will add just a hint of orange flavor.
[390 - 396] Once again it's simply a matter of folding this in until the ingredients are evenly distributed.
[396 - 401] You can do chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, really the possibilities are endless.
[402 - 418] Last I want to show you how to add in spices, which is super easy and I really don't have to show you, but I thought it would be fun to show a cinnamon muffin with cinnamon chips folded in, topped with a brown sugar streusel, and that's just delicious.
[418 - 427] I've already creamed together the butter and sugar, added in the eggs, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract, and now I'm going to add in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[427 - 430] You can use between 12 teaspoon and 1 full teaspoon.
[430 - 435] It really just depends on how pronounced you want that cinnamon flavor to be.
[436 - 441] Finish with the rest of the master muffin recipe by adding in the flour and buttermilk.
[441 - 449] I'm going to fold in 1 cup of cinnamon chips, which are delicious, but they can be a little harder to find when it's not the holidays.
[449 - 455] Go ahead and divide up the batter in your prepared muffin cups before making your streusel topping.
[455 - 462] A streusel is easy to make and it is a decadent addition to lots of different flavors of muffins.
[462 - 465] It starts with 14 cup of cold cubed butter.
[466 - 474] Then you'll add in 12 cup of brown sugar and 12 cup of allpurpose flour, adding in 14 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
[474 - 479] Then use a pastry cutter or you can use two knives, cutting across each other like this.
[480 - 485] Then you want to cut this all together until it resembles a coarse meal or sand.
[485 - 490] Then you want to sprinkle this generously on top of your muffin batter.
[490 - 495] It's almost like having little piles of sand on top of each muffin.
[495 - 498] And of course the baking time on all of these are the same.
[498 - 505] Now you know how to make pretty much any flavor of muffin that you want using one master recipe.
[516 - 517] Thanks for watching.
[517 - 522] You can find the full written recipe as well as other flavor ideas in the video description.

[26] Fold chocolate chips into batter using a spatula.
[27] Prepare muffin tins by buttering and flouring half, and using muffin papers for the other half.
[28] Use a large ice cream scoop to fill muffin tins to the brim.
[29] Distribute chocolate chips evenly among muffins.
[30] Top muffins with additional chocolate chips.
[31] Bake at 425°F for 5 minutes, then reduce to 350°F and bake for 20-25 minutes.
[32] Muffins are done when a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.
[33] Muffins baked without paper have a crisp edge, while those with paper are softer.

### DEFINITION
- A "Effect" is defined as a canonical answer to the question: "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?".
- "Effects" refers to the full set of canonical answers provided below. You must choose only from this set.

### INPUTS
- Canonical Effects (codebook) (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[A1] ..."):
[A1] prevent-sink
Definition: Stops mix-ins from settling to the bottom during baking.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries
	- Context 1: Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries. The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
	- Content 2: During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
	- Context 2: Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries. The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter. During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
```
[A2] texture
Definition: Affects crumb quality or fluffiness.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: fluffy and moist blueberry muffins
	- Context 2: Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
```
[A3] rise
Definition: Controls how the muffins rise (e.g., encouraging rise without overflowing).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
	- Context 1: You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches. Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
	- Content 2: a high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up
	- Context 2: We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
```
[A4] even-distribute
Definition: Ensures mix-ins (e.g., chocolate chips) are distributed evenly among portions.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full
	- Context 1: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full. It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
	- Content 2: You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
	- Context 2: When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount. You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
```
[A5] prevent-stick
Definition: Helps muffins release easily from the tin (prevents sticking to pan).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins sticking
	- Context 1: Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins sticking.
	- Content 2: Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners
	- Context 2: All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries. And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula. Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
```
[A6] accuracy
Definition: Improves measurement precision to ensure correct ingredient amounts and better results.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results
	- Context 1: I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
	- Content 2: It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
	- Context 2: It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly. It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
```
[A7] appearance
Definition: Improves look or finishing (e.g., glossy melty tops, crisp edges, dome shape).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Context 1: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Content 2: They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
	- Context 2: Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins. They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
```
[A8] optional-top
Definition: Marks toppings or finishing touches that are optional (decorative or flavor additions).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: This is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon
	- Context 1: Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too. This is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
	- Content 2: I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
	- Context 2: Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop. I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.

### DEFINITION
- A "Effect" is defined as a canonical answer to the question: "What intended outcome or effect does this information aim to achieve?".
- "Effects" refers to the full set of canonical answers provided below. You must choose only from this set.

### INPUTS
- Canonical Effects (codebook) (each starts with an ID in square brackets, e.g., "[A1] ..."):
[A1] prevent-sink
Definition: Stops mix-ins from settling to the bottom during baking.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries
	- Context 1: Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries. The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter.
	- Content 2: During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
	- Context 2: Now mix that reserved tablespoon of the flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries. The reason why we add that little tiny bit of flour to those blueberries is when we add them to the batter. During baking, the blueberries don't sink as fast when they're coated in flour.
```
[A2] texture
Definition: Affects crumb quality or fluffiness.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin
	- Context 1: Once all those white specks of flour start to disappear, you'll pour in 1 half cup of either milk or buttermilk. Buttermilk is going to give you a little bit of a poofier muffin, and you'll stir this in as well until it's well combined.
	- Content 2: fluffy and moist blueberry muffins
	- Context 2: Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins.
```
[A3] rise
Definition: Controls how the muffins rise (e.g., encouraging rise without overflowing).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
	- Context 1: You can let your muffin batter rest for about 15 minutes before popping it in the oven, or if you're making a larger batch, it's totally okay to let it rest in between cooking different batches. Bake your muffins in the 425 degree oven for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes reduce the temperature on your oven to 350 degrees without opening the oven door.
	- Content 2: a high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up
	- Context 2: We want a really high blast of heat when these go in because that'll set the edge and let them rise up so you'll have a nice bakerystyle dome on top.
```
[A4] even-distribute
Definition: Ensures mix-ins (e.g., chocolate chips) are distributed evenly among portions.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full
	- Context 1: We're going to divide the batter up amongst our 12 muffin cups, and you should fill each one about 2 thirds of the way full. It's always a little bit hard to tell what's 2 thirds or what's 3 quarters, so just try to divide your batter up as evenly as possible, because this does make 12 muffins.
	- Content 2: You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
	- Context 2: When you're scooping the batter, it's a nice time to kind of monitor the chocolate chips and make sure that no one is getting a sad amount. You wanna have an equal distribution, so if you notice that your scoop didn't get any chips, scoop up some chips.
```
[A5] prevent-stick
Definition: Helps muffins release easily from the tin (prevents sticking to pan).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins sticking
	- Context 1: Then line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Then I like to give mine just a spritz of nonstick cooking spray right on those paper baking cups, to prevent the muffins sticking.
	- Content 2: Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners
	- Context 2: All right, now the last and final step is adding in those blueberries. And at this point you want to fold it in with a spatula. Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop.
```
[A6] accuracy
Definition: Improves measurement precision to ensure correct ingredient amounts and better results.
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results
	- Context 1: I'm using a scale because that gives you the most accurate results, but if you're using cups, click up here for my how to measure flour video.
	- Content 2: It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
	- Context 2: It shows you all the ins and outs of measuring flour correctly. It's the thing that goes wrong the most often in baking, and it sucks when you add too much flour.
```
[A7] appearance
Definition: Improves look or finishing (e.g., glossy melty tops, crisp edges, dome shape).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Context 1: One fun topping you can experiment with is sprinkling on about 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar on top of your muffins. This gives it a nice little crunchy sweet top.
	- Content 2: They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
	- Context 2: Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com and today I'll be showing you how to make these fluffy and moist blueberry muffins. They're loaded with a ton of blueberries and they're topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel.
```
[A8] optional-top
Definition: Marks toppings or finishing touches that are optional (decorative or flavor additions).
Examples (Contents and Context): ```
	- Content 1: This is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon
	- Context 1: Continue on with the rest of the recipe, adding in the flour and buttermilk, once you have your batter finished, you'll add in 1 cup of fresh blueberries, or frozen even, you can use those too. This is optional, but I like to add in the zest of 1 lemon, so about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.
	- Content 2: I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.
	- Context 2: Now line your muffin tin with cupcake liners and begin scooping the batter out using a large cookie scoop. I like to top my blueberry muffins with a few extra blueberries on top, but that's totally optional.

[1] Hey guys, I'm Dina from simplyhomecooked.com
[2] Today I'll be showing you how to make fluffy and moist blueberry muffins
[3] Muffins are loaded with a ton of blueberries and topped with simple and delicious brown sugar streusel
[4] Start by combining all dry ingredients
[5] In a large bowl, combine two cups of all-purpose flour, a teaspoon of baking powder, half a teaspoon of baking soda, and a quarter teaspoon of salt
[6] Whisk all ingredients together
[7] Reserve one tablespoon of flour mixture
[8] Mix reserved tablespoon of flour mixture with one and a half cups of fresh blueberries
[9] Adding a little bit of flour to blueberries prevents them from sinking during baking
[10] Add three eggs to a large bowl
[11] Whisk eggs on high speed using an electric mixer for about three minutes until eggs become fluffy and pale
[12] Slowly add one cup of granulated sugar while continuing to beat eggs
[13] Continue beating eggs for three more minutes
[14] Well-beaten eggs are key to fluffy muffins
[15] Add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice
[16] Slowly add three-quarter cups of heavy cream while continuing to beat egg mixture
[17] Begin adding dry ingredients gradually using a sifter
[18] Add four tablespoons of melted unsalted butter while continuing to beat with electric mixer
[19] Add blueberries to the batter
[20] Fold blueberries in with a spatula
[21] Line muffin tin with cupcake liners
[22] Scoop batter using a large cookie scoop
[23] Optional: Top muffins with extra blueberries
[24] Prepare streusel topping by combining cold butter, flour, salt, cinnamon, and brown sugar in a small bowl
[25] Mash streusel ingredients together with a fork until crumbly
[26] Top blueberry muffins with streusel

### GOAL
For each piece, assign exactly one Specificity from the codebook when the content or context clearly answers the question "Does the instruction include precise measurements or temperatures?". 
If no Specificity is clearly supported, assign the empty string "".

### MATCHING RULES
- Choose only from the provided canonical Specificities; output the canonical string exactly as given.
- Treat synonyms/variants in the piece as mapping to the relevant canonical value; do not invent new values.
- Ignore negations, hypotheticals, and uncertain mentions (e.g., "maybe", "could", "if needed")—return "" in those cases.
- If multiple Specificities seem plausible, pick the single best answer that is most specific to the piece's content.
- Do not use external knowledge. Ground decisions strictly in the provided transcript.

### OUTPUT
Return a list of labeled pieces. Each piece should have the following fields:
- piece_id: id of the piece
- answer_id: id of the canonical Specificity from the codebook or ""
- answer: canonical Specificity string or ""

### NOTES
- Preserve the original order of pieces.
- Do not drop or merge pieces.
