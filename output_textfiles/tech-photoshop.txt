        "type": "text",
        "text": "63. If I turn on the original image, you can see where that fringing comes into play, and it just doesn't look as clean, so doing that Select and Mask adjustment afterwards is a really nice way to just touch everything up a bit so then when you go and add this into another photo or replace the background, you have a perfectly clean cutout."
